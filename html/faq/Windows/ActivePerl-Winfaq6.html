<h2><a name="How_do_I_use_Perl_for_Win32_unde">How do I use ActivePerl under
Apache?</a></h2>
<p>If you want to put all of your CGI scripts into one directory, add the
following line to your <em>srm.conf</em> file (You can choose any directory
you'd like, but make sure it exists):</p>
<pre>
    ScriptAlias /cgi-bin/ &quot;C:/Program Files/Apache Group/Apache/cgi-bin/&quot;
</pre>
<p>After you have made this change, stop and restart the Apache service.</p>
<p>Apache provides an emulation of the UNIX shebang (#!/path/to/perl) syntax, so
the next step is easy. You can put you Perl scripts into your <em>cgi-bin</em>
directory, as long as you have a path to a valid interpreter at the top. For
example:</p>
<pre>
    #!C:\PERL\5.00464\bin\MSWin32-x86\perl.exe
     
    use CGI qw(:standard) ;
    print header();
    print &quot;Hello, world&quot;;
</pre>
<p>If you want to enable CGI scripts based on an extension, such as <em>.pl</em>,
you need to add the following line to <em>srm.conf</em>:</p>
<pre>
    AddHandler cgi-script .pl
</pre>
<p>By default, CGI scripts are not allowed in your DocumentRoot directory, but
they are allowed in other document directories. Document directories are created
with the Alias command in <em>srm.conf</em>:</p>
<pre>
    Alias /ResourceKit/ &quot;E:/utilsamp/&quot;
</pre>
<p>You can then include files that end in <em>.pl</em> within a document
directory. You will still need to include the #! line with the full path to the <em>perl.exe</em>
interpreter, as shown earlier.</p>
<p>If you want to allow CGI scripts in the DocumentRoot directory, add the
ExecCGI option to the Options directive between the &lt;Directory&gt; and
&lt;/Directory&gt; entry for your DocumentRoot in <em>access.conf</em> (these
appear directly after the comment titled:</p>
<pre>
    # This should be changed to whatever you set DocumentRoot to.
    
After you have updated it, your Options directive may look something like:
</pre>
<pre>
    Options Indexes FollowSymLinks ExecCGI

<h2><a name="How_do_I_configure_the_EMWAC_htt">How do I configure the EMWAC
https server to support ActivePerl?</a></h2>
<p>First, read the EMWAC documentation:</p>
<pre>
    <a href="http://emwac.ed.ac.uk/html/internet_toolchest/https/scripts.htm">http://emwac.ed.ac.uk/html/internet_toolchest/https/scripts.htm</a>
</pre>
<p>You need to follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
  <li><strong><a name="item_"></a></strong>
    <p>Install ActivePerl.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Install the EMWAC server. Ensure that EMWAC can serve HTML files
    correctly.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Make sure that the bin subdirectory of your Perl directory is in the
    system <code>PATH</code> variable. This should be the subdirectory where
    perl.exe is located, such as <em>C:\Perl\bin</em>. Note that this must be
    set in the Control Panel, not on the command line, and it must be a system
    environment variable, not a user environment variable.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Make sure that your script has the extension <code>.pl</code>. This is
    the only way that the https service recognizes the file as a Perl script.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Ensure that the script is readable by the account used by the EMWAC
    server. Generally, this means you should make the script readable by the
    Everyone group.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Ensure that all supporting files, like the perl binary files, the perl
    library files, and the modules that you use, are all readable by the account
    used by the EMWAC server (i.e., the Everyone group).</p>
  </li>
</ol>
<p>When the EMWAC server gets an HTTP request for a file with a <em>.pl</em>
extension, it tries to execute <code>perl [filename]</code>. This is the only
way you can get Perl scripts to work on the EMWAC server, so you need to follow
the above directions.</p>
<p>By default, the ActivePerl installation puts the path to <em>perl.exe</em> in
<code>@INC</code>.</p>
<p>Because the EMWAC server runs as a service (see <a href="ActivePerl-Winfaq4.html#What_is_a_Windows_NT_service_">What
is a Windows NT service?</a>), you need to take special steps to make files and
environment variables like <code>PATH</code> accessible. Just because you can
read a script and run it from the command line doesn't mean that the server can.</p>
<hr>
<h2><a name="How_do_I_configure_IIS_3_0_or_lo">How do I configure IIS 3.0 or
lower to support ActivePerl?</a></h2>
<p>By default, the ActivePerl installation maps the <em>.plx</em> extension to
Perl for ISAPI. You can override the extension used during installation. Because
the installation does this only when IIS is already installed, you must install
IIS first, then install ActivePerl. If you need to reconfigure these settings,
or if you must set these by hand, the instructions in this section will prove
useful.</p>
<p>Microsoft Internet Information Server (IIS) ships with Windows NT Server.
Peer Web Services (PWS) ships with Windows NT Workstation. Configuring the
products is essentially the same. First, you should consult Chapter 8,
Publishing Information and Applications, in the IIS documentation.</p>
<p>You need to follow these steps to get ActivePerl scripts to run under IIS:</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Associate the extension for your scripts with the appropriate interpreter
    in the script map for IIS. This is under the Registry key HKEY_LOCAL_SYSTEM,
    with the sub-key ``System\CurrentControlSet\Services\W3SVC\Parameters\Script
    Map''. Many people map two extensions: one to <em>perl.exe</em> (for
    example, <em>.pl</em>) and another to <em>PerlIS.dll</em> (for example, <em>.plx</em>).
    Note that mapping an extension in the script map is <em>not</em> the same as
    associating the extension in Explorer. Use the full paths to the executable
    files in the script map.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Put your scripts in a virtual directory on the server that has Execute
    access but not Read access. You can add virtual directories or view their
    access with the Internet Service Manager. Remember that the URLs for your
    virtual directories can't overlap with URLs to directories in the WWW root
    directory. For example, You can't have a <em>cgi-bin</em> virtual directory
    and a real <em>cgi-bin</em> subdirectory of the WWW root.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Ensure that your scripts are readable by the account used by the IIS
    server. You set this account in Internet Service Manager; it is set to
    IUSR_[your server name] by default. See also <a href="ActivePerl-Winfaq4.html#What_is_a_Windows_NT_service_">What
    is a Windows NT service?</a> and <a href="ActivePerl-Winfaq4.html#How_do_I_set_permissions_on_a_fi">How
    do I set permissions on a file?</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Ensure that all supporting files, like the perl binary files, the perl
    library files, and the modules that you use, are all readable by the account
    used by the IIS server. See also <a href="ActivePerl-Winfaq4.html#What_is_a_Windows_NT_service_">What
    is a Windows NT service?</a> and <a href="ActivePerl-Winfaq4.html#How_do_I_set_permissions_on_a_fi">How
    do I set permissions on a file?</a>.</p>
  </li>
</ol>
<p>You need to restart the web service after making the Registry changes or
installing Perl.</p>
<p>Because IIS runs as a service (see <a href="ActivePerl-Winfaq4.html#What_is_a_Windows_NT_service_">What
is a Windows NT service?</a>), you need to take special steps to make sure that
files and environment variables are available to it.</p>
<hr>
<h2><a name="How_do_I_configure_Microsoft_IIS">How do I configure Microsoft IIS
4.0 to support ActivePerl?</a></h2>
<p>Microsoft IIS 4.0 ships with Windows NT Server 5.0, and PWS 4.0 ships with
Windows NT Workstation 5.0. Both IIS and PWS are available as part of the
Microsoft Windows NT 4.0 Option Pack. You can find a link to the Option Pack at <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/iis/">http://www.microsoft.com/iis/</a></p>
<p>To configure IIS or PWS 4.0 to run Perl scripts:</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Open the IIS 4.0 Internet Service Manager. This will bring up the
    Microsoft Management Console with the Internet Service Manager snap-in
    selected.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>From the tree display on the left, select the level at which to apply the
    mappings. You can choose an entire server, web site, or a given virtual
    directory.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Select Properties from the Action menu.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If you chose to administer the properties for the entire server, the
    Server Properties dialog will appear. Select WWW Service from the Master
    Properties pull-down menu and click the Edit button under Master Properties.
    This opens WWW Service Master Properties. Select the Home Directory tab and
    proceed to step 7.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If you chose to administer the properties for an entire web site, the Web
    Site Properties sheet appears. Select the Home Directory tab and proceed to
    step 7.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If you chose to administer the properties for a virtual directory, the
    Virtual Directory Properties sheet appears. Select the Virtual Directory tab
    and proceed to step 7.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Click the Configuration button. This opens the Application Configuration
    dialog.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Select the App Mappings tab and click the Add button. You see the
    Add/Edit Application Extension Mapping dialog.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To run Perl as a CGI application, type the full path to <em>Perl.EXE</em>
    followed by <code>%s %s</code>. When a script is executed, the first <code>%s</code>
    will be replaced by the full path to the script, and the second <code>%s</code>
    will be replaced by the script parameters.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To run Perl for ISAPI, type the full path to <em>PerlIS.DLL</em>. The <code>%s
    %s</code> is not required for ISAPI DLLs.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the Extension field, type <em>.pl</em> or <em>.plx</em> (or whatever
    extension you want to use).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The application mapping is now complete. Click the OK button and click OK
    to dismiss any remaining dialogs/property sheets.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Close the IIS 4.0 Internet Service Manager.</p>
  </li>
</ol>
<p>Because IIS runs as a service (see <a href="ActivePerl-Winfaq4.html#What_is_a_Windows_NT_service_">What
is a Windows NT service?</a>), you need to take special steps to make sure that
files and environment variables are available to it.</p>

<h2><a name="How_do_I_configure_Netscape_web_">How do I configure Netscape web
servers to support ActivePerl?</a></h2>
<p>If you're using Netscape 1.x servers, you must wrap your Perl scripts in
batch files. Refer to these Netscape tech notes:</p>
<pre>
    <a href="http://help.netscape.com/kb/server/960513-3.html">http://help.netscape.com/kb/server/960513-3.html</a>
    <a href="http://help.netscape.com/kb/server/960513-125.html">http://help.netscape.com/kb/server/960513-125.html</a> 
</pre>
<p>The following information is for Netscape FastTrack Server 2.0. Other 2.0 and
3.0 Netscape Servers (Communications, Enterprise) should be similar.</p>
<p>To set up ActivePerl to run on FastTrack Server, follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Install FastTrack Server, and make sure you can retrieve HTML pages.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Associate Perl scripts with the perl interpreter, if you haven't already.
    See <a href="ActivePerl-Winfaq4.html#How_do_I_associate_Perl_scripts_">How
    do I associate Perl scripts with perl?</a> for how to do this. You may need
    to re-start the server after making the association.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Set up a Shell CGI directory to run Perl scripts. A regular CGI directory
    will not work -- that is only for executable files. You set this up with the
    FastTrack Administrator; see the documentation for details.</p>
  </li>
</ol>
<p>If you would like to access Perl CGI scripts in other directories, you need
to associate an extension, such as <em>.pl</em>, with the shellcgi MIME type.
Before you follow these steps, you must add at least one Shell CGI directory -
this will enable shellcgi on your server (you can delete this directory, and
shellcgi will remain enabled). Follow these steps to associate <em>.pl</em> with
the shellcgi MIME type:</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p>In the Server Administrator, click Server Preferences, then select MIME
    Types from the frame on the left.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If you want to use <em>.pl</em> as the extension for Perl scripts, find
    and remove the application/x-perl MIME type (this is mapped to <em>.pl</em>
    by default).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Add a new MIME Type with magnus-internal/shellcgi as the Content Type,
    and pl as the File Suffix. If a type for magnus-internal/shellcgi already
    exists, simply add pl to the list of File Suffixes. Don't include the
    leading dot on the file suffix.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Save and apply these changes. You should be able to put a Perl CGI script
    in any directory, provided the script ends with the <em>.pl</em> suffix.</p>
  </li>
</ol>
<p>If you are having trouble running Perl scripts on your Netscape server, check
the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Ensure that the script is readable by the account used by the Netscape
    service. Generally, this means you should make the script readable by the
    Everyone group.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Ensure that all supporting files, like the perl binary files, the perl
    library files, and the modules that you use, are all readable by the account
    used by the Netscape service (i.e., the Everyone group).</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>One nice thing about FastTrack server is that the Error Log will give
detailed reasons why your CGI script isn't running, so this is a good thing to
check first when you are having configuration problems.</p>
<p>Because Netscape servers run as services (see <a href="ActivePerl-Winfaq4.html#What_is_a_Windows_NT_service_">What
is a Windows NT service?</a>), you need to take special steps to make sure that
files and environment variables are available to them.</p>
<p>Some people have reported problems with handling POST'ed data with Perl
programs with Netscape servers. Since Netscape apparently uses associations to
run scripts, and POST'ed data is sent on STDIN to a program. This may be related
to the problems with redirection.</p>

you use, are all readable by the account used by the WebSite service (i.e., the
Everyone group).</p>
<p>Because WebSite servers run as services (see <a href="ActivePerl-Winfaq4.html#What_is_a_Windows_NT_service_">What
is a Windows NT service?</a>), you need to take special steps to make sure that
files and environment variables are available to them.</p>

<h2><a name="How_do_I_configure_Purveyor_to_s">How do I configure Purveyor to
support ActivePerl?</a></h2>
<p>The following instructions are for Purveyor 1.2 for Windows NT. Other
Purveyor products should be similar.</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p>In the Purveyor Control Panel, use the CGI Mapping tab to map the <em>.pl</em>
    extension to <em>perl.exe</em>. Make sure that you use the full path to the
    executable.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Also in the Purveyor Control Panel, use the Virtual Servers section to
    set your CGI Scripts directory. You need one scripts directory for each
    virtual server you support. The scripts directory must be in the data path
    for the server. Also, make sure that the Disable CGI Extension checkbox is
    unchecked.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Ensure that the script is readable by the account used by the Purveyor
    service. Generally, this means you should make the script readable by the
    Everyone group.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Ensure that all supporting files, like the perl binary files, the perl
    library files, and the modules that you use, are all readable by the account
    used by the Purveyor service (i.e., the Everyone group).</p>
  </li>
</ol>
<p>If you have problems while configuring Purveyor to use ActivePerl, you can
use the Enable Tracing checkbox in the Logging tab of the Purveyor Control Panel
applet to trace HTTP requests and responses.</p>
<p>Because Purveyor runs as a service (see <a href="ActivePerl-Winfaq4.html#What_is_a_Windows_NT_service_">What
is a Windows NT service?</a>), you need to take special steps to make sure that
files and environment variables are available to it.</p>

<h2><a name="How_do_I_configure_Microsoft_Per">How do I configure Microsoft
Personal Web Server 1.0x for Windows 95 to support ActivePerl?</a></h2>
<p>Microsoft Personal Web Server for Windows 95 is a scaled-down version of
Microsoft Internet Information Server. Although it is not documented, it appears
that the method used to support ActivePerl with IIS will also work with Personal
Web Server. See <a href="#How_do_I_configure_IIS_3_0_or_lo">How do I configure
IIS 3.0 or lower to support ActivePerl?</a>.</p>
<hr>
<h2><a name="How_do_I_configure_other_web_ser">How do I configure other web
servers to support ActivePerl?</a></h2>
<p>If your web server isn't listed, check the server's documentation on how to
set up a CGI interpreter. In general the process is as follows:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Associate a file extension like <em>.pl</em> with the perl binary, and
    let the server know where the binary is. This may be a shell association,
    (see <a href="ActivePerl-Winfaq4.html#How_do_I_associate_Perl_scripts_">How
    do I associate Perl scripts with perl?</a>), or a custom association.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Set up a directory where executable scripts go, and put your Perl script
    there.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Ensure that the user account that the web server uses can read the script
    as well as any ancillary files (perl binary files, library files, modules,
    etc.). This usually means making the files available to the Everyone group.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>Because most web servers run as services (see <a href="#How_do_I_configure_IIS_3_0_or_lo">How
do I configure IIS 3.0 or lower to support ActivePerl?</a>), you need to take
special steps to make sure that files and environment variables are available to
them.</p>
<hr>
<h2><a name="My_program_runs_fine_from_the_co">My program runs fine from the
command line, but bombs out when run as a CGI script.</a></h2>
<p>Usually, this means one of two things: either you have misconfigured your
system, or your script does not output the right stuff to be a CGI script.</p>
<p>Before you do anything else, check this list:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Make sure you have correctly configured your server for <em>perl.exe</em>
    or <em>perlis.dll</em>. This is often accomplished by mapping a specific
    extension, such as <em>.pl</em> or <em>.plx</em>, to <em>perl.exe</em> or <em>perlis.dll</em>.
    Usually, web servers rely on their own mappings, rather than the Windows
    command-line mappings.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If your web server depends on the <code>PATH</code> variable to find <em>perl.exe</em>,
    make sure that you put <em>perl.exe</em> in your system <code>PATH</code>,
    not just your user <code>PATH</code>. This only applies to Windows NT/2000.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If your web server requires directories to be marked as executable, make
    sure the directory that contains the script is marked as such.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Since the web server can be configured to run as a local user, be sure
    that the user has access to the script file and the Perl binaries and
    libraries. Many web servers run as the ``Local System'' account, which
    generally has sufficient permissions.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If <em>Perl.exe</em> or Perl for ISAPI fail to work as expected check
    your event logs for clues.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>Check the information above with a script that you know produces the right
output for the CGI protocol (scripts in this FAQ are a good first choice). Try
it with your own script after you're sure the test script will work.</p>
<p>If you are sure the server is running the script, but it only generates error
messages in your browser, there are some tools that may help you out. CGI::Carp
is used to send debugging information to the browser or log file. Even if your
script has a compilation error, it can usually intercept and report errors. To
use CGI::Carp, include the following lines in your program:</p>
<pre>
    # The stuff in the BEGIN block will be executed very early
    # on, even before the rest of this script is parsed.
    #
    BEGIN {
        
        # Use the CGI::Carp module and import the carpout() function.
        #
        use CGI::Carp qw(carpout);
        
        # Send warnings and die messages to the browser.
        #
        carpout(STDOUT);
        
    }
</pre>
<p>If your script has an error, you may see something like this in the browser:</p>
<pre>
    [Wed Jun 3 09:32:28 1998] C:\inetpub\scripts\test.pl: Error message! at
    C:\inetpub\scripts\test.pl line 38. 
</pre>
<p>Sometimes, it can be helpful to put yourself in somebody else's position. The
libwww-perl bundle (LWP) is available from CPAN, but you can install it using
the Perl Package Manager (PPM). LWP may be included with future releases of
ActivePerl.</p>
<p>LWP includes the powerful <em>lwp-request</em> script, which lets you see
things from the browser's perspective. Invoke <em>lwp-request</em> with the name
of a URL to see the content of the response, as in <code>lwp-request
http://localhost</code>. To inspect the headers of an HTTP response, invoke <em>lwp-request</em>
with the <code>-de</code> switch:</p>
<pre>

<p>This tool can be very helpful in figuring out exactly what your scripts are
doing. Whatever you do, don't give up hope. It is, in fact, possible to get a
Perl script running on your web server. Really.</p>
<hr>
<h2><a name="This_is_all_such_a_hassle_why_c">This is all such a hassle; why
can't I just put perl.exe in my CGI directory and use it in my URL?</a></h2>
<p>First, the warning: DON'T DO THIS. REALLY. EVEN IF YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY
NOT, DON'T.</p>
<p>Now the explanation: the idea here is to put <em>perl.exe</em> in your CGI
directory (however you configure that on your server), and use URL syntax like
the following:</p>
<pre>
    http://soon.to.be.a.victim.net/cgi-bin/perl.exe?myscript.pl
</pre>
<p>to run <em>myscript.pl</em>. This keeps you from having to figure out how to
configure your server to associate extensions like <em>.pl</em> with an
interpreter like <em>perl.exe</em>.</p>
<p>In fact, on some early Win32-based web servers (Netscape 1.x servers in
particular), it was impossible to associate a script file with an interpreter.
This method was recommended by vendors as a viable approach to running Perl
scripts on your web server.</p>
<p>Anyone with a devious mind and a little knowledge of Perl can see that with
this configuration, hackers could start doing all kinds of horrible things on
the server. All they'd have to do is send made-up URLs, using the <code>-e</code>
command line switch in <em>perl.exe</em>, in order to do stuff like delete all
files on a drive:</p>
<pre>
    http://aaaugh.that.hurts.net/cgi-bin/perl.exe?-e?'del%20c:\*.*%20/S%20/Q'
</pre>
<p>Of course, a true computer criminal would never do something so crude and
obvious, but would instead use this as a launching point to cause irreparable
harm to your organization.</p>
<p>The following URL covers this issue in more depth:</p>
<pre>
    <a href="ftp://ftp.cert.org/pub/cert_advisories/CA-96.11.interpreters_in_cgi_bin_dir">ftp://cert.org/pub/cert_advisories/CA-96.11.interpreters_in_cgi_bin_dir</a>

<p>Tom Christiansen has also written a good discussion of the subject:</p>

</pre>
<p>Note that one suggested solution to this problem is wrapping your Perl script
in a batch file using pl2bat or your own custom batch code. THIS IS ALSO NOT
GOOD. Most of the primitive servers that won't allow file associations are also
susceptible to a bug that allows a user to enter any DOS command after the bat
file.</p>

<p>As a final note, there are so many good, free web servers out there for
Windows NT and Windows 95 that you should never stay with an old, insecure web
server.</p>
