<H1><A NAME="description">DESCRIPTION</A></H1>
<P>Both <CODE>install()</CODE> and <CODE>uninstall()</CODE> are specific to the way
ExtUtils::MakeMaker handles the installation and deinstallation of
perl modules. They are not designed as general purpose tools.</P>
<P><CODE>install()</CODE> takes three arguments. A reference to a hash, a verbose
switch and a don't-really-do-it switch. The hash ref contains a
mapping of directories: each key/value pair is a combination of
directories to be copied. Key is a directory to copy from, value is a
directory to copy to. The whole tree below the ``from'' directory will
be copied preserving timestamps and permissions.</P>
<P>There are two keys with a special meaning in the hash: ``read'' and
``write''. After the copying is done, install will write the list of
target files to the file named by <CODE>$hashref-&gt;{write}</CODE>. If there is
another file named by <CODE>$hashref-&gt;{read}</CODE>, the contents of this file will
be merged into the written file. The read and the written file may be
identical, but on AFS it is quite likely that people are installing to a
different directory than the one where the files later appear.</P>
<P><CODE>install_default()</CODE> takes one or less arguments.  If no arguments are 
specified, it takes $ARGV[0] as if it was specified as an argument.  
The argument is the value of MakeMaker's <CODE>FULLEXT</CODE> key, like <EM>Tk/Canvas</EM>.  
This function calls <CODE>install()</CODE> with the same arguments as the defaults 
the MakeMaker would use.</P>
<P>The argument-less form is convenient for install scripts like</P>
<PRE>
  perl -MExtUtils::Install -e install_default Tk/Canvas</PRE>
<P>Assuming this command is executed in a directory with a populated <EM>blib</EM> 
directory, it will proceed as if the <EM>blib</EM> was build by MakeMaker on 
this machine.  This is useful for binary distributions.</P>
<P><CODE>uninstall()</CODE> takes as first argument a file containing filenames to be
unlinked. The second argument is a verbose switch, the third is a
no-don't-really-do-it-now switch.</P>
<P><CODE>pm_to_blib()</CODE> takes a hashref as the first argument and copies all keys
of the hash to the corresponding values efficiently. Filenames with
the extension pm are autosplit. Second argument is the autosplit
directory.  If third argument is not empty, it is taken as a filter command
to be ran on each .pm file, the output of the command being what is finally
copied, and the source for auto-splitting.</P>
<P>You can have an environment variable PERL_INSTALL_ROOT set which will
be prepended as a directory to each installed file (and directory).</P>
