<P>perlfaq8 - System Interaction ($Revision: 1.39 $, $Date: 1999/05/23 18:37:57 $)</P>
<P>
<HR>
<H1><A NAME="description">DESCRIPTION</A></H1>
<P>This section of the Perl FAQ covers questions involving operating
system interaction.  Topics include interprocess communication (IPC),
control over the user-interface (keyboard, screen and pointing
devices), and most anything else not related to data manipulation.</P>
<P>Read the FAQs and documentation specific to the port of perl to your
operating system (eg, <A HREF="../../lib/Pod/perlvms.html">the perlvms manpage</A>, <EM>perlplan9</EM>, ...).  These should
contain more detailed information on the vagaries of your perl.</P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="how do i find out which operating system i'm running under">How do I find out which operating system I'm running under?</A></H2>
<P>The $^O variable ($OSNAME if you use English) contains an indication of
the name of the operating system (not its release number) that your perl
binary was built for.</P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="how come exec() doesn't return">How come <A HREF="../../lib/Pod/perlfunc.html#item_exec"><CODE>exec()</CODE></A> doesn't return?</A></H2>
<P>Because that's what it does: it replaces your currently running
program with a different one.  If you want to keep going (as is
probably the case if you're asking this question) use <A HREF="../../lib/Pod/perlfunc.html#item_system"><CODE>system()</CODE></A>
instead.</P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="how do i do fancy stuff with the keyboard/screen/mouse">How do I do fancy stuff with the keyboard/screen/mouse?</A></H2>
<P>How you access/control keyboards, screens, and pointing devices
(``mice'') is system-dependent.  Try the following modules:</P>
<DL>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_Keyboard">Keyboard</A></STRONG><BR>
<DD>
<PRE>
    Term::Cap                   Standard perl distribution
    Term::ReadKey               CPAN
    Term::ReadLine::Gnu         CPAN
    Term::ReadLine::Perl        CPAN
    Term::Screen                CPAN</PRE>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_Screen">Screen</A></STRONG><BR>
<DD>
<PRE>
    Term::Cap                   Standard perl distribution
    Curses                      CPAN
    Term::ANSIColor             CPAN</PRE>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_Mouse">Mouse</A></STRONG><BR>
<DD>
<PRE>
    Tk                          CPAN</PRE>
</DL>
<P>Some of these specific cases are shown below.</P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="how do i print something out in color">How do I print something out in color?</A></H2>
<P>In general, you don't, because you don't know whether
the recipient has a color-aware display device.  If you
know that they have an ANSI terminal that understands
color, you can use the Term::ANSIColor module from CPAN:</P>
<PRE>
    use Term::ANSIColor;
    print color(&quot;red&quot;), &quot;Stop!\n&quot;, color(&quot;reset&quot;);
    print color(&quot;green&quot;), &quot;Go!\n&quot;, color(&quot;reset&quot;);</PRE>
<P>Or like this:</P>
<PRE>
    use Term::ANSIColor qw(:constants);
    print RED, &quot;Stop!\n&quot;, RESET;
    print GREEN, &quot;Go!\n&quot;, RESET;</PRE>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="how do i read just one key without waiting for a return key">How do I read just one key without waiting for a return key?</A></H2>
<P>Controlling input buffering is a remarkably system-dependent matter.
On many systems, you can just use the <STRONG>stty</STRONG> command as shown in
<A HREF="../../lib/Pod/perlfunc.html#getc">getc in the perlfunc manpage</A>, but as you see, that's already getting you into
portability snags.</P>
<PRE>
    open(TTY, &quot;+&lt;/dev/tty&quot;) or die &quot;no tty: $!&quot;;
    system &quot;stty  cbreak &lt;/dev/tty &gt;/dev/tty 2&gt;&amp;1&quot;;
    $key = getc(TTY);           # perhaps this works
    # OR ELSE
    sysread(TTY, $key, 1);      # probably this does
    system &quot;stty -cbreak &lt;/dev/tty &gt;/dev/tty 2&gt;&amp;1&quot;;</PRE>
<P>The Term::ReadKey module from CPAN offers an easy-to-use interface that
should be more efficient than shelling out to <STRONG>stty</STRONG> for each key.
It even includes limited support for Windows.</P>
<PRE>
    use Term::ReadKey;
    ReadMode('cbreak');
    $key = ReadKey(0);
    ReadMode('normal');</PRE>
<P>However, using the code requires that you have a working C compiler
and can use it to build and install a CPAN module.  Here's a solution
using the standard POSIX module, which is already on your systems
(assuming your system supports POSIX).</P>
<PRE>
    use HotKey;
    $key = readkey();</PRE>
<P>And here's the HotKey module, which hides the somewhat mystifying calls
to manipulate the POSIX termios structures.</P>
<PRE>
    # HotKey.pm
    package HotKey;</PRE>
<PRE>
    @ISA = qw(Exporter);
    @EXPORT = qw(cbreak cooked readkey);</PRE>
<PRE>
    use strict;
    use POSIX qw(:termios_h);
    my ($term, $oterm, $echo, $noecho, $fd_stdin);</PRE>
<PRE>
    $fd_stdin = fileno(STDIN);
    $term     = POSIX::Termios-&gt;new();
    $term-&gt;getattr($fd_stdin);
    $oterm     = $term-&gt;getlflag();</PRE>
<PRE>
    $echo     = ECHO | ECHOK | ICANON;
    $noecho   = $oterm &amp; ~$echo;</PRE>
<PRE>
    sub cbreak {
        $term-&gt;setlflag($noecho);  # ok, so i don't want echo either
        $term-&gt;setcc(VTIME, 1);
        $term-&gt;setattr($fd_stdin, TCSANOW);
    }</PRE>
<PRE>
    sub cooked {
        $term-&gt;setlflag($oterm);
        $term-&gt;setcc(VTIME, 0);
        $term-&gt;setattr($fd_stdin, TCSANOW);
    }</PRE>
<PRE>
    sub readkey {
        my $key = '';
        cbreak();
        sysread(STDIN, $key, 1);
        cooked();
        return $key;
    }</PRE>
<PRE>
    END { cooked() }</PRE>
<PRE>
    1;</PRE>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="how do i check whether input is ready on the keyboard">How do I check whether input is ready on the keyboard?</A></H2>
<P>The easiest way to do this is to read a key in nonblocking mode with the
Term::ReadKey module from CPAN, passing it an argument of -1 to indicate
not to block:</P>
<PRE>
    use Term::ReadKey;</PRE>
<PRE>
    ReadMode('cbreak');</PRE>
<PRE>
    if (defined ($char = ReadKey(-1)) ) {
        # input was waiting and it was $char
    } else {
        # no input was waiting
    }</PRE>
<PRE>
    ReadMode('normal');                  # restore normal tty settings</PRE>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="how do i clear the screen">How do I clear the screen?</A></H2>
<P>If you only have do so infrequently, use <A HREF="../../lib/Pod/perlfunc.html#item_system"><CODE>system</CODE></A>:</P>
<PRE>
    system(&quot;clear&quot;);</PRE>
<P>If you have to do this a lot, save the clear string
so you can print it 100 times without calling a program
100 times:</P>
<PRE>
    $clear_string = `clear`;
    print $clear_string;</PRE>
<P>If you're planning on doing other screen manipulations, like cursor
positions, etc, you might wish to use Term::Cap module:</P>
<PRE>
    use Term::Cap;
    $terminal = Term::Cap-&gt;Tgetent( {OSPEED =&gt; 9600} );
    $clear_string = $terminal-&gt;Tputs('cl');</PRE>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="how do i get the screen size">How do I get the screen size?</A></H2>
<P>If you have Term::ReadKey module installed from CPAN, 
you can use it to fetch the width and height in characters
and in pixels:</P>
<PRE>
    use Term::ReadKey;
    ($wchar, $hchar, $wpixels, $hpixels) = GetTerminalSize();</PRE>
<P>This is more portable than the raw <A HREF="../../lib/Pod/perlfunc.html#item_ioctl"><CODE>ioctl</CODE></A>, but not as 
illustrative:</P>
<PRE>
    require 'sys/ioctl.ph';
    die &quot;no TIOCGWINSZ &quot; unless defined &amp;TIOCGWINSZ;
    open(TTY, &quot;+&lt;/dev/tty&quot;)                     or die &quot;No tty: $!&quot;;
    unless (ioctl(TTY, &amp;TIOCGWINSZ, $winsize='')) {
        die sprintf &quot;$0: ioctl TIOCGWINSZ (%08x: $!)\n&quot;, &amp;TIOCGWINSZ;
    }
    ($row, $col, $xpixel, $ypixel) = unpack('S4', $winsize);
    print &quot;(row,col) = ($row,$col)&quot;;
    print &quot;  (xpixel,ypixel) = ($xpixel,$ypixel)&quot; if $xpixel || $ypixel;
    print &quot;\n&quot;;</PRE>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="how do i ask the user for a password">How do I ask the user for a password?</A></H2>
<P>(This question has nothing to do with the web.  See a different
FAQ for that.)</P>
<P>There's an example of this in <A HREF="../../lib/Pod/perlfunc.html#crypt">crypt in the perlfunc manpage</A>).  First, you put the
terminal into ``no echo'' mode, then just read the password normally.
You may do this with an old-style <A HREF="../../lib/Pod/perlfunc.html#item_ioctl"><CODE>ioctl()</CODE></A> function, POSIX terminal
control (see <A HREF="../../lib/POSIX.html">the POSIX manpage</A> or its documentation the Camel Book), or a call
to the <STRONG>stty</STRONG> program, with varying degrees of portability.</P>
<P>You can also do this for most systems using the Term::ReadKey module
from CPAN, which is easier to use and in theory more portable.</P>
<PRE>
    use Term::ReadKey;</PRE>
<PRE>
    ReadMode('noecho');
    $password = ReadLine(0);</PRE>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="how do i read and write the serial port">How do I read and write the serial port?</A></H2>
<P>This depends on which operating system your program is running on.  In
the case of Unix, the serial ports will be accessible through files in
/dev; on other systems, device names will doubtless differ.
Several problem areas common to all device interaction are the
following:</P>
<DL>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_lockfiles">lockfiles</A></STRONG><BR>
<DD>
Your system may use lockfiles to control multiple access.  Make sure
you follow the correct protocol.  Unpredictable behavior can result
from multiple processes reading from one device.
<P></P>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_open_mode">open mode</A></STRONG><BR>
<DD>
If you expect to use both read and write operations on the device,
you'll have to open it for update (see <A HREF="../../lib/Pod/perlfunc.html#open">open in the perlfunc manpage</A> for
details).  You may wish to open it without running the risk of
blocking by using <A HREF="../../lib/Pod/perlfunc.html#item_sysopen"><CODE>sysopen()</CODE></A> and <CODE>O_RDWR|O_NDELAY|O_NOCTTY</CODE> from the
Fcntl module (part of the standard perl distribution).  See
<A HREF="../../lib/Pod/perlfunc.html#sysopen">sysopen in the perlfunc manpage</A> for more on this approach.
<P></P>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_end_of_line">end of line</A></STRONG><BR>
<DD>
Some devices will be expecting a ``\r'' at the end of each line rather
than a ``\n''.  In some ports of perl, ``\r'' and ``\n'' are different from
their usual (Unix) ASCII values of ``\012'' and ``\015''.  You may have to
give the numeric values you want directly, using octal (``\015''), hex
(``0x0D''), or as a control-character specification (``\cM'').
<PRE>
    print DEV &quot;atv1\012&quot;;       # wrong, for some devices
    print DEV &quot;atv1\015&quot;;       # right, for some devices</PRE>
<P>Even though with normal text files a ``\n'' will do the trick, there is
still no unified scheme for terminating a line that is portable
between Unix, DOS/Win, and Macintosh, except to terminate <EM>ALL</EM> line
ends with ``\015\012'', and strip what you don't need from the output.
This applies especially to socket I/O and autoflushing, discussed
next.</P>
<P></P>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_flushing_output">flushing output</A></STRONG><BR>
<DD>
If you expect characters to get to your device when you <A HREF="../../lib/Pod/perlfunc.html#item_print"><CODE>print()</CODE></A> them,
you'll want to autoflush that filehandle.  You can use <A HREF="../../lib/Pod/perlfunc.html#item_select"><CODE>select()</CODE></A>
and the <A HREF="../../lib/Pod/perlvar.html#item_%24%7C"><CODE>$|</CODE></A> variable to control autoflushing (see <A HREF="#">perlvar/$</A>
and <A HREF="../../lib/Pod/perlfunc.html#select">select in the perlfunc manpage</A>, or <A HREF="../../lib/Pod/perlfaq5.html">the perlfaq5 manpage</A>, ``How do I flush/unbuffer an
output filehandle?  Why must I do this?''):
<PRE>
    $oldh = select(DEV);
    $| = 1;
    select($oldh);</PRE>
<P>You'll also see code that does this without a temporary variable, as in</P>
<PRE>
    select((select(DEV), $| = 1)[0]);</PRE>
<P>Or if you don't mind pulling in a few thousand lines
of code just because you're afraid of a little $| variable:</P>
<PRE>
    use IO::Handle;
    DEV-&gt;autoflush(1);</PRE>
<P>As mentioned in the previous item, this still doesn't work when using
socket I/O between Unix and Macintosh.  You'll need to hardcode your
line terminators, in that case.</P>
<P></P>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_non%2Dblocking_input">non-blocking input</A></STRONG><BR>
<DD>
If you are doing a blocking <A HREF="../../lib/Pod/perlfunc.html#item_read"><CODE>read()</CODE></A> or sysread(), you'll have to
arrange for an alarm handler to provide a timeout (see
<A HREF="../../lib/Pod/perlfunc.html#alarm">alarm in the perlfunc manpage</A>).  If you have a non-blocking open, you'll likely
have a non-blocking read, which means you may have to use a 4-arg
<A HREF="../../lib/Pod/perlfunc.html#item_select"><CODE>select()</CODE></A> to determine whether I/O is ready on that device (see
<A HREF="../../lib/Pod/perlfunc.html#select">select in the perlfunc manpage</A>.
<P></P></DL>
<P>While trying to read from his caller-id box, the notorious Jamie Zawinski
&lt;<A HREF="mailto:jwz@netscape.com">jwz@netscape.com</A>&gt;, after much gnashing of teeth and fighting with sysread,
sysopen, POSIX's tcgetattr business, and various other functions that
go bump in the night, finally came up with this:</P>
<PRE>
    sub open_modem {
        use IPC::Open2;
        my $stty = `/bin/stty -g`;
        open2( \*MODEM_IN, \*MODEM_OUT, &quot;cu -l$modem_device -s2400 2&gt;&amp;1&quot;);
        # starting cu hoses /dev/tty's stty settings, even when it has
        # been opened on a pipe...
        system(&quot;/bin/stty $stty&quot;);
        $_ = &lt;MODEM_IN&gt;;
        chomp;
        if ( !m/^Connected/ ) {
            print STDERR &quot;$0: cu printed `$_' instead of `Connected'\n&quot;;
        }
    }</PRE>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="how do i decode encrypted password files">How do I decode encrypted password files?</A></H2>
<P>You spend lots and lots of money on dedicated hardware, but this is
bound to get you talked about.</P>
<P>Seriously, you can't if they are Unix password files--the Unix
password system employs one-way encryption.  It's more like hashing than
encryption.  The best you can check is whether something else hashes to
the same string.  You can't turn a hash back into the original string.
Programs like Crack
can forcibly (and intelligently) try to guess passwords, but don't
(can't) guarantee quick success.</P>
<P>If you're worried about users selecting bad passwords, you should
proactively check when they try to change their password (by modifying
passwd(1), for example).</P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="how do i start a process in the background">How do I start a process in the background?</A></H2>
<P>You could use</P>
<PRE>
    system(&quot;cmd &amp;&quot;)</PRE>
<P>or you could use fork as documented in <A HREF="../../lib/Pod/perlfunc.html#fork">fork in the perlfunc manpage</A>, with
further examples in <A HREF="../../lib/Pod/perlipc.html">the perlipc manpage</A>.  Some things to be aware of, if you're

<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_STDIN%2C_STDOUT%2C_and_STDERR_are_shared">STDIN, STDOUT, and STDERR are shared</A></STRONG><BR>
<DD>
Both the main process and the backgrounded one (the ``child'' process)
share the same STDIN, STDOUT and STDERR filehandles.  If both try to
access them at once, strange things can happen.  You may want to close
or reopen these for the child.  You can get around this with
<A HREF="../../lib/Pod/perlfunc.html#item_open"><CODE>open</CODE></A>ing a pipe (see <A HREF="../../lib/Pod/perlfunc.html#open">open in the perlfunc manpage</A>) but on some systems this
means that the child process cannot outlive the parent.
<P></P>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_Signals">Signals</A></STRONG><BR>
<DD>
You'll have to catch the SIGCHLD signal, and possibly SIGPIPE too.
SIGCHLD is sent when the backgrounded process finishes.  SIGPIPE is
sent when you write to a filehandle whose child process has closed (an
untrapped SIGPIPE can cause your program to silently die).  This is
not an issue with <A HREF="../../lib/Pod/perlfunc.html#item_system"><CODE>system(&quot;cmd&amp;&quot;)</CODE></A>.

<H2><A NAME="how do i trap control characters/signals">How do I trap control characters/signals?</A></H2>
<P>You don't actually ``trap'' a control character.  Instead, that character
generates a signal which is sent to your terminal's currently
foregrounded process group, which you then trap in your process.
Signals are documented in <A HREF="../../lib/Pod/perlipc.html#signals">Signals in the perlipc manpage</A> and the
section on ``Signals'' in the Camel.</P>
<P>Be warned that very few C libraries are re-entrant.  Therefore, if you
attempt to <A HREF="../../lib/Pod/perlfunc.html#item_print"><CODE>print()</CODE></A> in a handler that got invoked during another stdio
operation your internal structures will likely be in an
inconsistent state, and your program will dump core.  You can
sometimes avoid this by using <A HREF="../../lib/Pod/perlfunc.html#item_syswrite"><CODE>syswrite()</CODE></A> instead of print().</P>
<P>Unless you're exceedingly careful, the only safe things to do inside a
signal handler are (1) set a variable and (2) exit.  In the first case,
you should only set a variable in such a way that <CODE>malloc()</CODE> is not
called (eg, by setting a variable that already has a value).</P>
<P>For example:</P>
<PRE>
    $Interrupted = 0;   # to ensure it has a value
    $SIG{INT} = sub {
        $Interrupted++;
        syswrite(STDERR, &quot;ouch\n&quot;, 5);
    }</PRE>
<P>However, because syscalls restart by default, you'll find that if
you're in a ``slow'' call, such as &lt;FH&gt;, read(), connect(), or
wait(), that the only way to terminate them is by ``longjumping'' out;
that is, by raising an exception.  See the time-out handler for a
blocking <A HREF="../../lib/Pod/perlfunc.html#item_flock"><CODE>flock()</CODE></A> in <A HREF="../../lib/Pod/perlipc.html#signals">Signals in the perlipc manpage</A> or the section on ``Signals''

<H2><A NAME="how do i modify the shadow password file on a unix system">How do I modify the shadow password file on a Unix system?</A></H2>
<P>If perl was installed correctly and your shadow library was written
properly, the getpw*() functions described in <A HREF="../../lib/Pod/perlfunc.html">the perlfunc manpage</A> should in
theory provide (read-only) access to entries in the shadow password
file.  To change the file, make a new shadow password file (the format
varies from system to system--see <EM>passwd(5)</EM> for specifics) and use
<CODE>pwd_mkdb(8)</CODE> to install it (see <EM>pwd_mkdb(8)</EM> for more details).</P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="how do i set the time and date">How do I set the time and date?</A></H2>

the VMS equivalent is <CODE>set time</CODE>.</P>

probably get away with setting an environment variable:</P>

<P>If you want finer granularity than the 1 second that the <A HREF="../../lib/Pod/perlfunc.html#item_sleep"><CODE>sleep()</CODE></A>

<P>Release 5 of Perl added the END block, which can be used to simulate
atexit().  Each package's END block is called when the program or
thread ends (see <A HREF="../../lib/Pod/perlmod.html">the perlmod manpage</A> manpage for more details).</P>
<P>For example, you can use this to make sure your filter program
managed to finish its output without filling up the disk:</P>
<PRE>
    END {
        close(STDOUT) || die &quot;stdout close failed: $!&quot;;

<P>The END block isn't called when untrapped signals kill the program,

<PRE>
        use sigtrap qw(die normal-signals);</PRE>
<P>Perl's exception-handling mechanism is its <A HREF="../../lib/Pod/perlfunc.html#item_eval"><CODE>eval()</CODE></A> operator.  You can
use <A HREF="../../lib/Pod/perlfunc.html#item_eval"><CODE>eval()</CODE></A> as setjmp and <A HREF="../../lib/Pod/perlfunc.html#item_die"><CODE>die()</CODE></A> as longjmp.  For details of this, see

<P>Some Sys-V based systems, notably Solaris 2.X, redefined some of the
standard socket constants.  Since these were constant across all
architectures, they were often hardwired into perl code.  The proper
way to deal with this is to ``use Socket'' to get the correct values.</P>
<P>Note that even though SunOS and Solaris are binary compatible, these

<P>
<H2><A NAME="how can i call my system's unique c functions from perl">How can I call my system's unique C functions from Perl?</A></H2>
<P>In most cases, you write an external module to do it--see the answer
to ``Where can I learn about linking C with Perl? [h2xs, xsubpp]''.
However, if the function is a system call, and your system supports
syscall(), you can use the syscall function (documented in
<A HREF="../../lib/Pod/perlfunc.html">the perlfunc manpage</A>).</P>
<P>Remember to check the modules that came with your distribution, and
CPAN as well--someone may already have written a module to do it.</P>

<P>Historically, these would be generated by the h2ph tool, part of the
standard perl distribution.  This program converts <CODE>cpp(1)</CODE> directives
in C header files to files containing subroutine definitions, like
&amp;SYS_getitimer, which you can use as arguments to your functions.
It doesn't work perfectly, but it usually gets most of the job done.
Simple files like <EM>errno.h</EM>, <EM>syscall.h</EM>, and <EM>socket.h</EM> were fine,
but the hard ones like <EM>ioctl.h</EM> nearly always need to hand-edited.
Here's how to install the *.ph files:</P>
<PRE>
    1.  become super-user
    2.  cd /usr/include
    3.  h2ph *.h */*.h</PRE>
<P>If your system supports dynamic loading, for reasons of portability and
sanity you probably ought to use h2xs (also part of the standard perl
distribution).  This tool converts C header files to Perl extensions.
See <A HREF="../../lib/Pod/perlxstut.html">the perlxstut manpage</A> for how to get started with h2xs.</P>
<P>If your system doesn't support dynamic loading, you still probably
ought to use h2xs.  See <A HREF="../../lib/Pod/perlxstut.html">the perlxstut manpage</A> and <A HREF="../../lib/ExtUtils/MakeMaker.html">the ExtUtils::MakeMaker manpage</A> for
more information (in brief, just use <STRONG>make perl</STRONG> instead of a plain

<H2><A NAME="why do setuid perl scripts complain about kernel problems">Why do setuid perl scripts complain about kernel problems?</A></H2>
<P>Some operating systems have bugs in the kernel that make setuid

<P>
<H2><A NAME="how can i open a pipe both to and from a command">How can I open a pipe both to and from a command?</A></H2>
<P>The IPC::Open2 module (part of the standard perl distribution) is an
easy-to-use approach that internally uses pipe(), fork(), and <A HREF="../../lib/Pod/perlfunc.html#item_exec"><CODE>exec()</CODE></A> to do
the job.  Make sure you read the deadlock warnings in its documentation,
though (see <A HREF="../../lib/IPC/Open2.html">the IPC::Open2 manpage</A>).  See 
<A HREF="../../lib/Pod/perlipc.html#bidirectional communication with another process">Bidirectional Communication with Another Process in the perlipc manpage</A> and 
<A HREF="../../lib/Pod/perlipc.html#bidirectional communication with yourself">Bidirectional Communication with Yourself in the perlipc manpage</A></P>
<P>You may also use the IPC::Open3 module (part of the standard perl

<P>You're confusing the purpose of <A HREF="../../lib/Pod/perlfunc.html#item_system"><CODE>system()</CODE></A> and backticks (``).  <A HREF="../../lib/Pod/perlfunc.html#item_system"><CODE>system()</CODE></A>
runs a command and returns exit status information (as a 16 bit value:
the low 7 bits are the signal the process died from, if any, and
the high 8 bits are the actual exit value).  Backticks (``) run a
command and return what it sent to STDOUT.</P>
<PRE>
    $exit_status   = system(&quot;mail-users&quot;);

<P>
<H2><A NAME="how can i capture stderr from an external command">How can I capture STDERR from an external command?</A></H2>
<P>There are three basic ways of running external commands:</P>
<PRE>
    system $cmd;                # using system()
    $output = `$cmd`;           # using backticks (``)
    open (PIPE, &quot;cmd |&quot;);       # using open()</PRE>
<P>With system(), both STDOUT and STDERR will go the same place as the
script's STDOUT and STDERR, unless the <A HREF="../../lib/Pod/perlfunc.html#item_system"><CODE>system()</CODE></A> command redirects them.
Backticks and <A HREF="../../lib/Pod/perlfunc.html#item_open"><CODE>open()</CODE></A> read <STRONG>only</STRONG> the STDOUT of your command.</P>
<P>With any of these, you can change file descriptors before the call:</P>
<PRE>
    open(STDOUT, &quot;&gt;logfile&quot;);
    system(&quot;ls&quot;);</PRE>
<P>or you can use Bourne shell file-descriptor redirection:</P>
<PRE>
    $output = `$cmd 2&gt;some_file`;
    open (PIPE, &quot;cmd 2&gt;some_file |&quot;);</PRE>
<P>You can also use file-descriptor redirection to make STDERR a
duplicate of STDOUT:</P>
<PRE>
    $output = `$cmd 2&gt;&amp;1`;
    open (PIPE, &quot;cmd 2&gt;&amp;1 |&quot;);</PRE>
<P>Note that you <EM>cannot</EM> simply open STDERR to be a dup of STDOUT
in your Perl program and avoid calling the shell to do the redirection.
This doesn't work:</P>
<PRE>
    open(STDERR, &quot;&gt;&amp;STDOUT&quot;);
    $alloutput = `cmd args`;  # stderr still escapes</PRE>
<P>This fails because the <A HREF="../../lib/Pod/perlfunc.html#item_open"><CODE>open()</CODE></A> makes STDERR go to where STDOUT was
going at the time of the open().  The backticks then make STDOUT go to
a string, but don't change STDERR (which still goes to the old
STDOUT).</P>
<P>Note that you <EM>must</EM> use Bourne shell (sh(1)) redirection syntax in
backticks, not csh(1)!  Details on why Perl's <A HREF="../../lib/Pod/perlfunc.html#item_system"><CODE>system()</CODE></A> and backtick
and pipe opens all use the Bourne shell are in
<A HREF="http://www.perl.com/CPAN/doc/FMTEYEWTK/versus/csh.whynot">http://www.perl.com/CPAN/doc/FMTEYEWTK/versus/csh.whynot</A> .
To capture a command's STDERR and STDOUT together:</P>
<PRE>
    $output = `cmd 2&gt;&amp;1`;                       # either with backticks
    $pid = open(PH, &quot;cmd 2&gt;&amp;1 |&quot;);              # or with an open pipe
    while (&lt;PH&gt;) { }                            #    plus a read</PRE>
<P>To capture a command's STDOUT but discard its STDERR:</P>

    $output = `cmd 2&gt;/dev/null`;                # either with backticks
    $pid = open(PH, &quot;cmd 2&gt;/dev/null |&quot;);       # or with an open pipe
    while (&lt;PH&gt;) { }                            #    plus a read</PRE>
<P>To capture a command's STDERR but discard its STDOUT:</P>
<PRE>
    $output = `cmd 2&gt;&amp;1 1&gt;/dev/null`;           # either with backticks
    $pid = open(PH, &quot;cmd 2&gt;&amp;1 1&gt;/dev/null |&quot;);  # or with an open pipe
    while (&lt;PH&gt;) { }                            #    plus a read</PRE>
<P>To exchange a command's STDOUT and STDERR in order to capture the STDERR
but leave its STDOUT to come out our old STDERR:</P>
<PRE>
    $output = `cmd 3&gt;&amp;1 1&gt;&amp;2 2&gt;&amp;3 3&gt;&amp;-`;        # either with backticks
    $pid = open(PH, &quot;cmd 3&gt;&amp;1 1&gt;&amp;2 2&gt;&amp;3 3&gt;&amp;-|&quot;);# or with an open pipe
    while (&lt;PH&gt;) { }                            #    plus a read</PRE>
<P>To read both a command's STDOUT and its STDERR separately, it's easiest
and safest to redirect them separately to files, and then read from those
files when the program is done:</P>
<PRE>
    system(&quot;program args 1&gt;/tmp/program.stdout 2&gt;/tmp/program.stderr&quot;);</PRE>
<P>Ordering is important in all these examples.  That's because the shell
processes file descriptor redirections in strictly left to right order.</P>
<PRE>
    system(&quot;prog args 1&gt;tmpfile 2&gt;&amp;1&quot;);
    system(&quot;prog args 2&gt;&amp;1 1&gt;tmpfile&quot;);</PRE>
<P>The first command sends both standard out and standard error to the
temporary file.  The second command sends only the old standard output
there, and the old standard error shows up on the old standard out.</P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="why doesn't open() return an error when a pipe open fails">Why doesn't <A HREF="../../lib/Pod/perlfunc.html#item_open"><CODE>open()</CODE></A> return an error when a pipe open fails?</A></H2>
<P>Because the pipe open takes place in two steps: first Perl calls
<A HREF="../../lib/Pod/perlfunc.html#item_fork"><CODE>fork()</CODE></A> to start a new process, then this new process calls <A HREF="../../lib/Pod/perlfunc.html#item_exec"><CODE>exec()</CODE></A> to
run the program you really wanted to open.  The first step reports
success or failure to your process, so <A HREF="../../lib/Pod/perlfunc.html#item_open"><CODE>open()</CODE></A> can only tell you
whether the <A HREF="../../lib/Pod/perlfunc.html#item_fork"><CODE>fork()</CODE></A> succeeded or not.</P>
<P>To find out if the <A HREF="../../lib/Pod/perlfunc.html#item_exec"><CODE>exec()</CODE></A> step succeeded, you have to catch SIGCHLD
and <A HREF="../../lib/Pod/perlfunc.html#item_wait"><CODE>wait()</CODE></A> to get the exit status.  You should also catch SIGPIPE if
you're writing to the child--you may not have found out the <A HREF="../../lib/Pod/perlfunc.html#item_exec"><CODE>exec()</CODE></A>
failed by the time you write.  This is documented in <A HREF="../../lib/Pod/perlipc.html">the perlipc manpage</A>.</P>
<P>In some cases, even this won't work.  If the second argument to a
piped <A HREF="../../lib/Pod/perlfunc.html#item_open"><CODE>open()</CODE></A> contains shell metacharacters, perl fork()s, then exec()s
a shell to decode the metacharacters and eventually run the desired
program.  Now when you call wait(), you only learn whether or not the
<EM>shell</EM> could be successfully started...it's best to avoid shell
metacharacters.</P>
<P>On systems that follow the <CODE>spawn()</CODE> paradigm, <A HREF="../../lib/Pod/perlfunc.html#item_open"><CODE>open()</CODE></A> <EM>might</EM> do what
you expect--unless perl uses a shell to start your command. In this
case the <A HREF="../../lib/Pod/perlfunc.html#item_fork"><CODE>fork()/exec()</CODE></A> description still applies.</P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="what's wrong with using backticks in a void context">What's wrong with using backticks in a void context?</A></H2>
<P>Strictly speaking, nothing.  Stylistically speaking, it's not a good
way to write maintainable code because backticks have a (potentially
humongous) return value, and you're ignoring it.  It's may also not be very
efficient, because you have to read in all the lines of output, allocate
memory for them, and then throw it away.  Too often people are lulled
to writing:</P>
<PRE>
    `cp file file.bak`;</PRE>
<P>And now they think ``Hey, I'll just always use backticks to run programs.''
Bad idea: backticks are for capturing a program's output; the <A HREF="../../lib/Pod/perlfunc.html#item_system"><CODE>system()</CODE></A>
function is for running programs.</P>
<P>Consider this line:</P>
<PRE>
    `cat /etc/termcap`;</PRE>
<P>You haven't assigned the output anywhere, so it just wastes memory
(for a little while).  You forgot to check <A HREF="../../lib/Pod/perlvar.html#item_%24%3F"><CODE>$?</CODE></A> to see whether
the program even ran correctly, too.  Even if you wrote</P>
<PRE>
    print `cat /etc/termcap`;</PRE>
<P>this code could and probably should be written as</P>
<PRE>
    system(&quot;cat /etc/termcap&quot;) == 0
        or die &quot;cat program failed!&quot;;</PRE>
<P>which will get the output quickly (as it is generated, instead of only
at the end) and also check the return value.</P>
<P><A HREF="../../lib/Pod/perlfunc.html#item_system"><CODE>system()</CODE></A> also provides direct control over whether shell wildcard
processing may take place, whereas backticks do not.</P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="how can i call backticks without shell processing">How can I call backticks without shell processing?</A></H2>
<P>This is a bit tricky.  Instead of writing</P>

<PRE>
    my @ok = ();

<P>Just as with system(), no shell escapes happen when you <A HREF="../../lib/Pod/perlfunc.html#item_exec"><CODE>exec()</CODE></A> a list.

<P>Note that if you're stuck on Microsoft, no solution to this vexing issue
is even possible.  Even if Perl were to emulate fork(), you'd still
be hosed, because Microsoft gives no argc/argv-style API.  Their API

<H2><A NAME="how can i convert my shell script to perl">How can I convert my shell script to perl?</A></H2>
<P>Learn Perl and rewrite it.  Seriously, there's no simple converter.
Things that are awkward to do in the shell are easy to do in Perl, and
this very awkwardness is what would make a shell-&gt;perl converter
nigh-on impossible to write.  By rewriting it, you'll think about what
you're really trying to do, and hopefully will escape the shell's
pipeline datastream paradigm, which while convenient for some matters,
causes many inefficiencies.</P>

<H2><A NAME="can i use perl to run a telnet or ftp session">Can I use perl to run a telnet or ftp session?</A></H2>
<P>Try the Net::FTP, TCP::Client, and Net::Telnet modules (available from
CPAN).  <A HREF="http://www.perl.com/CPAN/scripts/netstuff/telnet.emul.shar">http://www.perl.com/CPAN/scripts/netstuff/telnet.emul.shar</A>
will also help for emulating the telnet protocol, but Net::Telnet is
quite probably easier to use..</P>
<P>If all you want to do is pretend to be telnet but don't need
the initial telnet handshaking, then the standard dual-process
approach will suffice:</P>

<H2><A NAME="how can i write expect in perl">How can I write expect in Perl?</A></H2>
<P>Once upon a time, there was a library called chat2.pl (part of the
standard perl distribution), which never really got finished.  If you
find it somewhere, <EM>don't use it</EM>.  These days, your best bet is to
look at the Expect module available from CPAN, which also requires two
other modules from CPAN, IO::Pty and IO::Stty.</P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="is there a way to hide perl's command line from programs such as ps">Is there a way to hide perl's command line from programs such as ``ps''?</A></H2>
<P>First of all note that if you're doing this for security reasons (to
avoid people seeing passwords, for example) then you should rewrite
your program so that critical information is never given as an
argument.  Hiding the arguments won't make your program completely
secure.</P>
<P>To actually alter the visible command line, you can assign to the
variable $0 as documented in <A HREF="../../lib/Pod/perlvar.html">the perlvar manpage</A>.  This won't work on all
operating systems, though.  Daemon programs like sendmail place their
state there, as in:</P>

In the strictest sense, it can't be done--the script executes as a
different process from the shell it was started from.  Changes to a
process are not reflected in its parent--only in any children
created after the change.  There is shell magic that may allow you to
fake it by eval()ing the script's output in your shell; check out the
comp.unix.questions FAQ for details.

<H2><A NAME="how do i close a process's filehandle without waiting for it to complete">How do I close a process's filehandle without waiting for it to complete?</A></H2>
<P>Assuming your system supports such things, just send an appropriate signal
to the process (see <A HREF="../../lib/Pod/perlfunc.html#kill">kill in the perlfunc manpage</A>).  It's common to first send a TERM
signal, wait a little bit, and then send a KILL signal to finish it off.</P>

<P>If by daemon process you mean one that's detached (disassociated from

Unixish systems.  Non-Unix users should check their Your_OS::Process
module for other solutions.</P>
<UL>
<LI>
Open /dev/tty and use the TIOCNOTTY ioctl on it.  See <EM>tty(4)</EM>
for details.  Or better yet, you can just use the POSIX::setsid()
function, so you don't have to worry about process groups.
<P></P>
<LI>
Change directory to /
<P></P>
<LI>
Reopen STDIN, STDOUT, and STDERR so they're not connected to the old
tty.

<P>On POSIX systems, you can test whether your own process group matches
the current process group of your controlling terminal as follows:</P>

sample code) and then have a signal handler for the INT signal that

<H2><A NAME="how do i open a file without blocking">How do I open a file without blocking?</A></H2>
<P>If you're lucky enough to be using a system that supports

O_NDELAY or O_NONBLOCK flag from the Fcntl module in conjunction with
sysopen():</P>
<PRE>
    use Fcntl;
    sysopen(FH, &quot;/tmp/somefile&quot;, O_WRONLY|O_NDELAY|O_CREAT, 0644)

<P>If your version of perl is compiled without dynamic loading, then you
just need to replace step 3 (<STRONG>make</STRONG>) with <STRONG>make perl</STRONG> and you will
get a new <EM>perl</EM> binary with your extension linked in.</P>
<P>See <A HREF="../../lib/ExtUtils/MakeMaker.html">the ExtUtils::MakeMaker manpage</A> for more details on building extensions.
See also the next question, ``What's the difference between require
and use?''.</P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="what's the difference between require and use">What's the difference between require and use?</A></H2>
<P>Perl offers several different ways to include code from one file into
another.  Here are the deltas between the various inclusion constructs:</P>
<PRE>
    1)  do $file is like eval `cat $file`, except the former
        1.1: searches @INC and updates %INC.
        1.2: bequeaths an *unrelated* lexical scope on the eval'ed code.</PRE>
<PRE>
    2)  require $file is like do $file, except the former
        2.1: checks for redundant loading, skipping already loaded files.
        2.2: raises an exception on failure to find, compile, or execute $file.</PRE>
<PRE>
    3)  require Module is like require &quot;Module.pm&quot;, except the former
        3.1: translates each &quot;::&quot; into your system's directory separator.
        3.2: primes the parser to disambiguate class Module as an indirect object.</PRE>
<PRE>
    4)  use Module is like require Module, except the former
        4.1: loads the module at compile time, not run-time.
        4.2: imports symbols and semantics from that package to the current one.</PRE>
<P>In general, you usually want <A HREF="../../lib/Pod/perlfunc.html#item_use"><CODE>use</CODE></A> and a proper Perl module.</P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="how do i keep my own module/library directory">How do I keep my own module/library directory?</A></H2>
<P>When you build modules, use the PREFIX option when generating
Makefiles:</P>
<PRE>
    perl Makefile.PL PREFIX=/u/mydir/perl</PRE>
<P>then either set the PERL5LIB environment variable before you run
scripts that use the modules/libraries (see <A HREF="../../lib/Pod/perlrun.html">the perlrun manpage</A>) or say</P>
<PRE>
    use lib '/u/mydir/perl';</PRE>
<P>This is almost the same as</P>
<PRE>
    BEGIN {
        unshift(@INC, '/u/mydir/perl');
    }</PRE>
<P>except that the lib module checks for machine-dependent subdirectories.
See Perl's <A HREF="../../lib/lib.html">the lib manpage</A> for more information.</P>

<H2><A NAME="how do i add a directory to my include path at runtime">How do I add a directory to my include path at runtime?</A></H2>
<P>Here are the suggested ways of modifying your include path:</P>
<PRE>
    the PERLLIB environment variable
    the PERL5LIB environment variable
    the perl -Idir command line flag
    the use lib pragma, as in
        use lib &quot;$ENV{HOME}/myown_perllib&quot;;</PRE>
<P>The latter is particularly useful because it knows about machine
dependent architectures.  The lib.pm pragmatic module was first
included with the 5.002 release of Perl.</P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="what is socket.ph and where do i get it">What is socket.ph and where do I get it?</A></H2>
<P>It's a perl4-style file defining values for system networking
constants.  Sometimes it is built using h2ph when Perl is installed,
but other times it is not.  Modern programs <CODE>use Socket;</CODE> instead.</P>
