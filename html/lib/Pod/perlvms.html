<P>perlvms - VMS-specific documentation for Perl</P>
<P>
<HR>
<H1><A NAME="description">DESCRIPTION</A></H1>
<P>Gathered below are notes describing details of Perl 5's 
behavior on VMS.  They are a supplement to the regular Perl 5 
documentation, so we have focussed on the ways in which Perl 
5 functions differently under VMS than it does under Unix, 
and on the interactions between Perl and the rest of the 
operating system.  We haven't tried to duplicate complete 
descriptions of Perl features from the main Perl 
documentation, which can be found in the <EM>[.pod]</EM> 
subdirectory of the Perl distribution.</P>
<P>We hope these notes will save you from confusion and lost 
sleep when writing Perl scripts on VMS.  If you find we've 
missed something you think should appear here, please don't 
hesitate to drop a line to <A HREF="mailto:vmsperl@newman.upenn.edu.">vmsperl@newman.upenn.edu.</A></P>
<P>
<HR>
<H1><A NAME="installation">Installation</A></H1>
<P>Directions for building and installing Perl 5 can be found in 
the file <EM>README.vms</EM> in the main source directory of the 
Perl distribution..</P>
<P>
<HR>
<H1><A NAME="organization of perl images">Organization of Perl Images</A></H1>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="core images">Core Images</A></H2>
<P>During the installation process, three Perl images are produced.
<EM>Miniperl.Exe</EM> is an executable image which contains all of
the basic functionality of Perl, but cannot take advantage of
Perl extensions.  It is used to generate several files needed
to build the complete Perl and various extensions.  Once you've
finished installing Perl, you can delete this image.</P>
<P>Most of the complete Perl resides in the shareable image
<EM>PerlShr.Exe</EM>, which provides a core to which the Perl executable
image and all Perl extensions are linked.  You should place this
image in <EM>Sys$Share</EM>, or define the logical name <EM>PerlShr</EM> to
translate to the full file specification of this image.  It should
be world readable.  (Remember that if a user has execute only access
to <EM>PerlShr</EM>, VMS will treat it as if it were a privileged shareable
image, and will therefore require all downstream shareable images to be
INSTALLed, etc.)</P>
<P>Finally, <EM>Perl.Exe</EM> is an executable image containing the main
entry point for Perl, as well as some initialization code.  It
should be placed in a public directory, and made world executable.
In order to run Perl with command line arguments, you should
define a foreign command to invoke this image.</P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="perl extensions">Perl Extensions</A></H2>
<P>Perl extensions are packages which provide both XS and Perl code
to add new functionality to perl.  (XS is a meta-language which
simplifies writing C code which interacts with Perl, see
<A HREF="../../lib/Pod/perlxs.html">the perlxs manpage</A> for more details.)  The Perl code for an
extension is treated like any other library module - it's
made available in your script through the appropriate
<A HREF="../../lib/Pod/perlfunc.html#item_use"><CODE>use</CODE></A> or <A HREF="../../lib/Pod/perlfunc.html#item_require"><CODE>require</CODE></A> statement, and usually defines a Perl
package containing the extension.</P>
<P>The portion of the extension provided by the XS code may be
connected to the rest of Perl in either of two ways.  In the
<STRONG>static</STRONG> configuration, the object code for the extension is
linked directly into <EM>PerlShr.Exe</EM>, and is initialized whenever
Perl is invoked.  In the <STRONG>dynamic</STRONG> configuration, the extension's
machine code is placed into a separate shareable image, which is
mapped by Perl's DynaLoader when the extension is <A HREF="../../lib/Pod/perlfunc.html#item_use"><CODE>use</CODE></A>d or
<A HREF="../../lib/Pod/perlfunc.html#item_require"><CODE>require</CODE></A>d in your script.  This allows you to maintain the
extension as a separate entity, at the cost of keeping track of the
additional shareable image.  Most extensions can be set up as either
static or dynamic.</P>
<P>The source code for an extension usually resides in its own
directory.  At least three files are generally provided:
<EM>Extshortname</EM><EM>.xs</EM> (where <EM>Extshortname</EM> is the portion of
the extension's name following the last <CODE>::</CODE>), containing
the XS code, <EM>Extshortname</EM><EM>.pm</EM>, the Perl library module
for the extension, and <EM>Makefile.PL</EM>, a Perl script which uses
the <CODE>MakeMaker</CODE> library modules supplied with Perl to generate
a <EM>Descrip.MMS</EM> file for the extension.</P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="installing static extensions">Installing static extensions</A></H2>
<P>Since static extensions are incorporated directly into
<EM>PerlShr.Exe</EM>, you'll have to rebuild Perl to incorporate a
new extension.  You should edit the main <EM>Descrip.MMS</EM> or <EM>Makefile</EM>
you use to build Perl, adding the extension's name to the <CODE>ext</CODE>
macro, and the extension's object file to the <CODE>extobj</CODE> macro.
You'll also need to build the extension's object file, either
by adding dependencies to the main <EM>Descrip.MMS</EM>, or using a
separate <EM>Descrip.MMS</EM> for the extension.  Then, rebuild
<EM>PerlShr.Exe</EM> to incorporate the new code.</P>
<P>Finally, you'll need to copy the extension's Perl library
module to the <EM>[.</EM><EM>Extname</EM><EM>]</EM> subdirectory under one
of the directories in <A HREF="../../lib/Pod/perlvar.html#item_%40INC"><CODE>@INC</CODE></A>, where <EM>Extname</EM> is the name
of the extension, with all <CODE>::</CODE> replaced by <CODE>.</CODE> (e.g.
the library module for extension Foo::Bar would be copied
to a <EM>[.Foo.Bar]</EM> subdirectory).</P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="installing dynamic extensions">Installing dynamic extensions</A></H2>
<P>In general, the distributed kit for a Perl extension includes
a file named Makefile.PL, which is a Perl program which is used
to create a <EM>Descrip.MMS</EM> file which can be used to build and
install the files required by the extension.  The kit should be
unpacked into a directory tree <STRONG>not</STRONG> under the main Perl source
directory, and the procedure for building the extension is simply</P>
<PRE>
    $ perl Makefile.PL  ! Create Descrip.MMS
    $ mmk               ! Build necessary files
    $ mmk test          ! Run test code, if supplied
    $ mmk install       ! Install into public Perl tree</PRE>
<P><EM>N.B.</EM> The procedure by which extensions are built and
tested creates several levels (at least 4) under the
directory in which the extension's source files live.
For this reason, you shouldn't nest the source directory
too deeply in your directory structure, lest you exceed RMS'
maximum of 8 levels of subdirectory in a filespec.  (You
can use rooted logical names to get another 8 levels of
nesting, if you can't place the files near the top of
the physical directory structure.)</P>
<P>VMS support for this process in the current release of Perl
is sufficient to handle most extensions.  However, it does
not yet recognize extra libraries required to build shareable
images which are part of an extension, so these must be added
to the linker options file for the extension by hand.  For
instance, if the <EM>PGPLOT</EM> extension to Perl requires the
<EM>PGPLOTSHR.EXE</EM> shareable image in order to properly link
the Perl extension, then the line <CODE>PGPLOTSHR/Share</CODE> must
be added to the linker options file <EM>PGPLOT.Opt</EM> produced
during the build process for the Perl extension.</P>
<P>By default, the shareable image for an extension is placed
<EM>[.lib.site_perl.auto</EM><EM>Arch</EM>.<EM>Extname</EM><EM>]</EM> directory of the
installed Perl directory tree (where <EM>Arch</EM> is <EM>VMS_VAX</EM> or
<EM>VMS_AXP</EM>, and <EM>Extname</EM> is the name of the extension, with
each <CODE>::</CODE> translated to <CODE>.</CODE>).  (See the MakeMaker documentation
for more details on installation options for extensions.)
However, it can be manually placed in any of several locations:
   - the <EM>[.Lib.Auto.</EM><EM>Arch</EM><EM>$PVers</EM><EM>Extname</EM><EM>]</EM> subdirectory
     of one of the directories in <A HREF="../../lib/Pod/perlvar.html#item_%40INC"><CODE>@INC</CODE></A> (where <EM>PVers</EM>
     is the version of Perl you're using, as supplied in <A HREF="../../lib/Pod/perlvar.html#item_%24%5D"><CODE>$]</CODE></A>,
     with '.' converted to '_'), or
   - one of the directories in <A HREF="../../lib/Pod/perlvar.html#item_%40INC"><CODE>@INC</CODE></A>, or
   - a directory which the extensions Perl library module
     passes to the DynaLoader when asking it to map
     the shareable image, or
   - <EM>Sys$Share</EM> or <EM>Sys$Library</EM>.
If the shareable image isn't in any of these places, you'll need
to define a logical name <EM>Extshortname</EM>, where <EM>Extshortname</EM>
is the portion of the extension's name after the last <CODE>::</CODE>, which
translates to the full file specification of the shareable image.</P>
<P>
<HR>
<H1><A NAME="file specifications">File specifications</A></H1>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="syntax">Syntax</A></H2>
<P>We have tried to make Perl aware of both VMS-style and Unix-
style file specifications wherever possible.  You may use 
either style, or both, on the command line and in scripts, 
but you may not combine the two styles within a single file 
specification.  VMS Perl interprets Unix pathnames in much
the same way as the CRTL (<EM>e.g.</EM> the first component of
an absolute path is read as the device name for the
VMS file specification).  There are a set of functions
provided in the <CODE>VMS::Filespec</CODE> package for explicit
interconversion between VMS and Unix syntax; its
documentation provides more details.</P>
<P>Filenames are, of course, still case-insensitive.  For
consistency, most Perl routines return  filespecs using
lower case letters only, regardless of the case used in
the arguments passed to them.  (This is true  only when
running under VMS; Perl respects the case-sensitivity
of OSs like Unix.)</P>
<P>We've tried to minimize the dependence of Perl library 
modules on Unix syntax, but you may find that some of these, 
as well as some scripts written for Unix systems, will 
require that you use Unix syntax, since they will assume that 
'/' is the directory separator, <EM>etc.</EM>  If you find instances 
of this in the Perl distribution itself, please let us know, 
so we can try to work around them.</P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="wildcard expansion">Wildcard expansion</A></H2>
<P>File specifications containing wildcards are allowed both on 
the command line and within Perl globs (e.g. &lt;C&lt;*.c&gt;&gt;).  If
the wildcard filespec uses VMS syntax, the resultant 
filespecs will follow VMS syntax; if a Unix-style filespec is 
passed in, Unix-style filespecs will be returned.</P>
<P>In both cases, VMS wildcard expansion is performed. (csh-style
wildcard expansion is available if you use <CODE>File::Glob::glob</CODE>.)
If the wildcard filespec contains a device or directory 
specification, then the resultant filespecs will also contain 
a device and directory; otherwise, device and directory 
information are removed.  VMS-style resultant filespecs will 
contain a full device and directory, while Unix-style 
resultant filespecs will contain only as much of a directory 
path as was present in the input filespec.  For example, if 
your default directory is Perl_Root:[000000], the expansion 
of <CODE>[.t]*.*</CODE> will yield filespecs  like 
``perl_root:[t]base.dir'', while the expansion of <CODE>t/*/*</CODE> will 
yield filespecs like ``t/base.dir''.  (This is done to match 
the behavior of glob expansion performed by Unix shells.)</P>
<P>Similarly, the resultant filespec will contain the file version
only if one was present in the input filespec.</P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="pipes">Pipes</A></H2>
<P>Input and output pipes to Perl filehandles are supported; the 
``file name'' is passed to lib$spawn() for asynchronous 
execution.  You should be careful to close any pipes you have 
opened in a Perl script, lest you leave any ``orphaned'' 
subprocesses around when Perl exits.</P>
<P>You may also use backticks to invoke a DCL subprocess, whose 
output is used as the return value of the expression.  The 
string between the backticks is handled as if it were the
argument to the <A HREF="#item_system"><CODE>system</CODE></A> operator (see below).  In this case,
Perl will wait for the subprocess to complete before continuing.</P>
<P>
<HR>
<H1><A NAME="perl5lib and perllib">PERL5LIB and PERLLIB</A></H1>
<P>The PERL5LIB and PERLLIB logical names work as documented in <A HREF="../../lib/Pod/perl.html">the perl manpage</A>,
except that the element separator is '|' instead of ':'.  The
directory specifications may use either VMS or Unix syntax.</P>
<P>
<HR>
<H1><A NAME="command line">Command line</A></H1>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="i/o redirection and backgrounding">I/O redirection and backgrounding</A></H2>
<P>Perl for VMS supports redirection of input and output on the 
command line, using a subset of Bourne shell syntax:</P>
<PRE>
    &lt;F&lt;file&gt; reads stdin from F&lt;file&gt;,
    &gt;F&lt;file&gt; writes stdout to F&lt;file&gt;,
    &gt;&gt;F&lt;file&gt; appends stdout to F&lt;file&gt;,
    2&gt;F&lt;file&gt; writes stderr to F&lt;file&gt;, and
    2&gt;&gt;F&lt;file&gt; appends stderr to F&lt;file&gt;.</PRE>
<P>In addition, output may be piped to a subprocess, using the  
character '|'.  Anything after this character on the command 
line is passed to a subprocess for execution; the subprocess 
takes the output of Perl as its input.</P>
<P>Finally, if the command line ends with '&amp;', the entire 
command is run in the background as an asynchronous 
subprocess.</P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="command line switches">Command line switches</A></H2>
<P>The following command line switches behave differently under
VMS than described in <A HREF="../../lib/Pod/perlrun.html">the perlrun manpage</A>.  Note also that in order
to pass uppercase switches to Perl, you need to enclose
them in double-quotes on the command line, since the CRTL
downcases all unquoted strings.</P>
<DL>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_%2Di">-i</A></STRONG><BR>
<DD>
If the <A HREF="#item_%2Di"><CODE>-i</CODE></A> switch is present but no extension for a backup
copy is given, then inplace editing creates a new version of
a file; the existing copy is not deleted.  (Note that if
an extension is given, an existing file is renamed to the backup
file, as is the case under other operating systems, so it does
not remain as a previous version under the original filename.)
<P></P>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_%2DS">-S</A></STRONG><BR>
<DD>
If the <A HREF="#item_%2DS"><CODE>-S</CODE></A> switch is present <EM>and</EM> the script name does
not contain a directory, then Perl translates the logical
name DCL$PATH as a searchlist, using each translation as
a directory in which to look for the script.  In addition,
if no file type is specified, Perl looks in each directory
for a file matching the name specified, with a blank type,
a type of <EM>.pl</EM>, and a type of <EM>.com</EM>, in that order.
<P></P>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_%2Du">-u</A></STRONG><BR>
<DD>
The <A HREF="#item_%2Du"><CODE>-u</CODE></A> switch causes the VMS debugger to be invoked
after the Perl program is compiled, but before it has
run.  It does not create a core dump file.
<P></P></DL>

<H1><A NAME="perl functions">Perl functions</A></H1>
<P>As of the time this document was last revised, the following

<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_File_tests">File tests</A></STRONG><BR>
<DD>
The tests <CODE>-b</CODE>, <CODE>-B</CODE>, <A HREF="../../lib/Pod/perlrun.html#item_%2Dc"><CODE>-c</CODE></A>, <A HREF="../../lib/Pod/perlrun.html#item_%2DC"><CODE>-C</CODE></A>, <A HREF="../../lib/Pod/perlrun.html#item_%2Dd"><CODE>-d</CODE></A>, <CODE>-e</CODE>, <CODE>-f</CODE>,

advertised.  The return values for <CODE>-r</CODE>, <A HREF="../../lib/Pod/perlrun.html#item_%2Dw"><CODE>-w</CODE></A>, and <CODE>-x</CODE>
tell you whether you can actually access the file; this may
not reflect the UIC-based file protections.  Since real and
effective UIC don't differ under VMS, <CODE>-O</CODE>, <CODE>-R</CODE>, <A HREF="../../lib/Pod/perlrun.html#item_%2DW"><CODE>-W</CODE></A>,
and <A HREF="../../lib/Pod/perlrun.html#item_%2DX"><CODE>-X</CODE></A> are equivalent to <CODE>-o</CODE>, <CODE>-r</CODE>, <A HREF="../../lib/Pod/perlrun.html#item_%2Dw"><CODE>-w</CODE></A>, and <CODE>-x</CODE>.
Similarly, several other tests, including <CODE>-A</CODE>, <CODE>-g</CODE>, <CODE>-k</CODE>,
<CODE>-l</CODE>, <A HREF="../../lib/Pod/perlrun.html#item_%2Dp"><CODE>-p</CODE></A>, and <A HREF="#item_%2Du"><CODE>-u</CODE></A>, aren't particularly meaningful under
VMS, and the values returned by these tests reflect whatever
your CRTL <A HREF="#item_stat"><CODE>stat()</CODE></A> routine does to the equivalent bits in the
st_mode field.  Finally, <A HREF="../../lib/Pod/perlrun.html#item_%2Dd"><CODE>-d</CODE></A> returns true if passed a device
specification without an explicit directory (e.g. <CODE>DUA1:</CODE>), as
well as if passed a directory.
<P>Note: Some sites have reported problems when using the file-access
tests (<CODE>-r</CODE>, <A HREF="../../lib/Pod/perlrun.html#item_%2Dw"><CODE>-w</CODE></A>, and <CODE>-x</CODE>) on files accessed via DEC's DFS.
Specifically, since DFS does not currently provide access to the
extended file header of files on remote volumes, attempts to
examine the ACL fail, and the file tests will return false,
with <A HREF="#item_%24%21"><CODE>$!</CODE></A> indicating that the file does not exist.  You can
use <A HREF="#item_stat"><CODE>stat</CODE></A> on these files, since that checks UIC-based protection
only, and then manually check the appropriate bits, as defined by
your C compiler's <EM>stat.h</EM>, in the mode value it returns, if you
need an approximation of the file's protections.</P>
<P></P>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_backticks">backticks</A></STRONG><BR>
<DD>
Backticks create a subprocess, and pass the enclosed string
to it for execution as a DCL command.  Since the subprocess is
created directly via <CODE>lib$spawn()</CODE>, any valid DCL command string
may be specified.
<P></P>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_binmode">binmode FILEHANDLE</A></STRONG><BR>
<DD>
The <A HREF="#item_binmode"><CODE>binmode</CODE></A> operator will attempt to insure that no translation
of carriage control occurs on input from or output to this filehandle.
Since this involves reopening the file and then restoring its
file position indicator, if this function returns FALSE, the
underlying filehandle may no longer point to an open file, or may
point to a different position in the file than before <A HREF="#item_binmode"><CODE>binmode</CODE></A>
was called.
<P>Note that <A HREF="#item_binmode"><CODE>binmode</CODE></A> is generally not necessary when using normal
filehandles; it is provided so that you can control I/O to existing
record-structured files when necessary.  You can also use the
<CODE>vmsfopen</CODE> function in the VMS::Stdio extension to gain finer
control of I/O to files and devices with different record structures.</P>
<P></P>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_crypt">crypt PLAINTEXT, USER</A></STRONG><BR>
<DD>
The <A HREF="#item_crypt"><CODE>crypt</CODE></A> operator uses the <CODE>sys$hash_password</CODE> system
service to generate the hashed representation of PLAINTEXT.
If USER is a valid username, the algorithm and salt values
are taken from that user's UAF record.  If it is not, then
the preferred algorithm and a salt of 0 are used.  The
quadword encrypted value is returned as an 8-character string.
<P>The value returned by <A HREF="#item_crypt"><CODE>crypt</CODE></A> may be compared against
the encrypted password from the UAF returned by the <CODE>getpw*</CODE>
functions, in order to authenticate users.  If you're
going to do this, remember that the encrypted password in
the UAF was generated using uppercase username and
password strings; you'll have to upcase the arguments to
<A HREF="#item_crypt"><CODE>crypt</CODE></A> to insure that you'll get the proper value:</P>

<DD>
Rather than causing Perl to abort and dump core, the <A HREF="#item_dump"><CODE>dump</CODE></A>
operator invokes the VMS debugger.  If you continue to
execute the Perl program under the debugger, control will
be transferred to the label specified as the argument to
<A HREF="#item_dump"><CODE>dump</CODE></A>, or, if no label was specified, back to the
beginning of the program.  All other state of the program
(<EM>e.g.</EM> values of variables, open file handles) are not
affected by calling <A HREF="#item_dump"><CODE>dump</CODE></A>.
<P></P>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_exec">exec LIST</A></STRONG><BR>
<DD>
The <A HREF="#item_exec"><CODE>exec</CODE></A> operator behaves in one of two different ways.  
If called after a call to <A HREF="#item_fork"><CODE>fork</CODE></A>, it will invoke the CRTL 
<CODE>execv()</CODE> routine, passing its arguments to the subprocess 
created by <A HREF="#item_fork"><CODE>fork</CODE></A> for execution.  In this case, it is 
subject to all limitations that affect <CODE>execv()</CODE>.  (In 
particular, this usually means that the command executed in 
the subprocess must be an image compiled from C source code, 
and that your options for passing file descriptors and signal 
handlers to the subprocess are limited.)
<P>If the call to <A HREF="#item_exec"><CODE>exec</CODE></A> does not follow a call to <A HREF="#item_fork"><CODE>fork</CODE></A>, it 
will cause Perl to exit, and to invoke the command given as 
an argument to <A HREF="#item_exec"><CODE>exec</CODE></A> via <CODE>lib$do_command</CODE>.  If the argument 
begins with '@' or '$' (other than as part of a filespec), then it 
is executed as a DCL command.  Otherwise, the first token on 
the command line is treated as the filespec of an image to 
run, and an attempt is made to invoke it (using <EM>.Exe</EM> and 
the process defaults to expand the filespec) and pass the 
rest of <A HREF="#item_exec"><CODE>exec</CODE></A>'s argument to it as parameters.  If the token
has no file type, and matches a file with null type, then an
attempt is made to determine whether the file is an executable
image which should be invoked using <CODE>MCR</CODE> or a text file which
should be passed to DCL as a command procedure.</P>
<P>You can use <A HREF="#item_exec"><CODE>exec</CODE></A> in both ways within the same script, as 
long as you call <A HREF="#item_fork"><CODE>fork</CODE></A> and <A HREF="#item_exec"><CODE>exec</CODE></A> in pairs.  Perl
keeps track of how many times <A HREF="#item_fork"><CODE>fork</CODE></A> and <A HREF="#item_exec"><CODE>exec</CODE></A> have been
called, and will call the CRTL <CODE>execv()</CODE> routine if there have
previously been more calls to <A HREF="#item_fork"><CODE>fork</CODE></A> than to <A HREF="#item_exec"><CODE>exec</CODE></A>.</P>
<P></P>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_fork">fork</A></STRONG><BR>
<DD>
The <A HREF="#item_fork"><CODE>fork</CODE></A> operator works in the same way as the CRTL 
<CODE>vfork()</CODE> routine, which is quite different under VMS than 
under Unix.  Specifically, while <A HREF="#item_fork"><CODE>fork</CODE></A> returns 0 after it 
is called and the subprocess PID after <A HREF="#item_exec"><CODE>exec</CODE></A> is called, in 
both cases the thread of execution is within the parent 
process, so there is no opportunity to perform operations in 
the subprocess before calling <A HREF="#item_exec"><CODE>exec</CODE></A>.
<P>In general, the use of <A HREF="#item_fork"><CODE>fork</CODE></A> and <A HREF="#item_exec"><CODE>exec</CODE></A> to create 
subprocess is not recommended under VMS; wherever possible, 
use the <A HREF="#item_system"><CODE>system</CODE></A> operator or piped filehandles instead.</P>

SYS$TIMEZONE_DIFFERENTIAL is defined as the number of seconds
which must be added to UTC to yield local time.  (This logical
name is defined automatically if you are running a version of
VMS with built-in UTC support.)  If neither of these cases is

service is called directly.  This insures that the target
process is actually deleted, if at all possible.  (The CRTL's <A HREF="#item_kill"><CODE>kill()</CODE></A>

Since VMS keeps track of files according to a different scheme

in the <CODE>st_dev</CODE> and <CODE>st_ino</CODE> fields of a <CODE>struct stat</CODE>.  Perl
tries its best, though, and the values it uses are pretty unlikely

<P></P>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_system">system LIST</A></STRONG><BR>
<DD>
The <A HREF="#item_system"><CODE>system</CODE></A> operator creates a subprocess, and passes its 
arguments to the subprocess for execution as a DCL command.  
Since the subprocess is created directly via <CODE>lib$spawn()</CODE>, any 
valid DCL command string may be specified.  If the string begins with
'@', it is treated as a DCL command unconditionally.  Otherwise, if
the first token contains a character used as a delimiter in file
specification (e.g. <CODE>:</CODE> or <CODE>]</CODE>), an attempt is made to expand it
using  a default type of <EM>.Exe</EM> and the process defaults, and if
successful, the resulting file is invoked via <CODE>MCR</CODE>. This allows you
to invoke an image directly simply by passing the file specification
to <A HREF="#item_system"><CODE>system</CODE></A>, a common Unixish idiom.  If the token has no file type,
and matches a file with null type, then an attempt is made to
determine whether the file is an executable image which should be
invoked using <CODE>MCR</CODE> or a text file which should be passed to DCL
as a command procedure.
<P>If LIST consists of the empty string, <A HREF="#item_system"><CODE>system</CODE></A> spawns an
interactive DCL subprocess, in the same fashion as typing
<STRONG>SPAWN</STRONG> at the DCL prompt.</P>
<P>Perl waits for the subprocess to complete before continuing
execution in the current process.  As described in <A HREF="../../lib/Pod/perlfunc.html">the perlfunc manpage</A>,
the return value of <A HREF="#item_system"><CODE>system</CODE></A> is a fake ``status'' which follows
POSIX semantics; see the description of <A HREF="#item_%24%3F"><CODE>$?</CODE></A> in this document
for more detail.  The actual VMS exit status of the subprocess
is available in <A HREF="#item_%24%5ES"><CODE>$^S</CODE></A> (as long as you haven't used another Perl

Therefore, the ``system time'' elements will always be 0, since 
there is no difference between ``user time'' and ``system'' time 
under VMS, and the time accumulated by a subprocess may or may 
not appear separately in the ``child time'' field, depending on 
whether <A HREF="#item_times">times</A> keeps track of subprocesses separately.  Note
especially that the VAXCRTL (at least) keeps track only of
subprocesses spawned using <A HREF="#item_fork">fork</A> and <A HREF="#item_exec">exec</A>; it will not

an element of <A HREF="#item_%ENV"><CODE>%ENV</CODE></A>, the local symbol table is scanned first, followed
by the global symbol table..  The characters following <CODE>CLISYM_</CODE> are
significant when an element of <A HREF="#item_%ENV"><CODE>%ENV</CODE></A> is set or deleted: if the

<P></P></DL>
<P><EM>PERL_ENV_TABLES</EM> is translated once when Perl starts up; any changes
you make while Perl is running do not affect the behavior of <A HREF="#item_%ENV"><CODE>%ENV</CODE></A>.
If <EM>PERL_ENV_TABLES</EM> is not defined, then Perl defaults to consulting
first the logical name tables specified by <EM>LNM$FILE_DEV</EM>, and then
the CRTL <CODE>environ</CODE> array.</P>
<P>In all operations on %ENV, the key string is treated as if it 
were entirely uppercase, regardless of the case actually 
specified in the Perl expression.</P>
<P>When an element of <A HREF="#item_%ENV"><CODE>%ENV</CODE></A> is read, the locations to which
<EM>PERL_ENV_TABLES</EM> points are checked in order, and the value
obtained from the first successful lookup is returned.  If the
name of the <A HREF="#item_%ENV"><CODE>%ENV</CODE></A> element contains a semi-colon, it and
any characters after it are removed.  These are ignored when
the CRTL <CODE>environ</CODE> array or a CLI symbol table is consulted.
However, the name is looked up in a logical name table, the
suffix after the semi-colon is treated as the translation index
to be used for the lookup.   This lets you look up successive values
for search list logical names.  For instance, if you say</P>
<PRE>
   $  Define STORY  once,upon,a,time,there,was
   $  perl -e &quot;for ($i = 0; $i &lt;= 6; $i++) &quot; -
   _$ -e &quot;{ print $ENV{'story;'.$i},' '}&quot;</PRE>
<P>Perl will print <CODE>ONCE UPON A TIME THERE WAS</CODE>, assuming, of course,
that <EM>PERL_ENV_TABLES</EM> is set up so that the logical name <CODE>story</CODE>
is found, rather than a CLI symbol or CRTL <CODE>environ</CODE> element with
the same name.</P>
<P>When an element of <A HREF="#item_%ENV"><CODE>%ENV</CODE></A> is set to a defined string, the
corresponding definition is made in the location to which the
first translation of <EM>PERL_ENV_TABLES</EM> points.  If this causes a
logical name to be created, it is defined in supervisor mode.
(The same is done if an existing logical name was defined in
executive or kernel mode; an existing user or supervisor mode
logical name is reset to the new value.)  If the value is an empty
string, the logical name's translation is defined as a single NUL
(ASCII 00) character, since a logical name cannot translate to a
zero-length string.  (This restriction does not apply to CLI symbols
or CRTL <CODE>environ</CODE> values; they are set to the empty string.)
An element of the CRTL <CODE>environ</CODE> array can be set only if your
copy of Perl knows about the CRTL's <CODE>setenv()</CODE> function.  (This is
present only in some versions of the DECCRTL; check <CODE>$Config{d_setenv}</CODE>
to see whether your copy of Perl was built with a CRTL that has this
function.)</P>
<P>When an element of <A HREF="#item_%ENV"><CODE>%ENV</CODE></A> is set to <A HREF="../../lib/Pod/perlfunc.html#item_undef"><CODE>undef</CODE></A>,
the element is looked up as if it were being read, and if it is
found, it is deleted.  (An item ``deleted'' from the CRTL <CODE>environ</CODE>
array is set to the empty string; this can only be done if your
copy of Perl knows about the CRTL <CODE>setenv()</CODE> function.)  Using
<A HREF="../../lib/Pod/perlfunc.html#item_delete"><CODE>delete</CODE></A> to remove an element from <A HREF="#item_%ENV"><CODE>%ENV</CODE></A> has a similar effect,
but after the element is deleted, another attempt is made to
look up the element, so an inner-mode logical name or a name in
another location will replace the logical name just deleted.
In either case, only the first value found searching PERL_ENV_TABLES
is altered.  It is not possible at present to define a search list
logical name via %ENV.</P>
<P>The element <CODE>$ENV{DEFAULT}</CODE> is special: when read, it returns
Perl's current default device and directory, and when set, it
resets them, regardless of the definition of <EM>PERL_ENV_TABLES</EM>.
It cannot be cleared or deleted; attempts to do so are silently
ignored.</P>
<P>Note that if you want to pass on any elements of the
C-local environ array to a subprocess which isn't
started by fork/exec, or isn't running a C program, you
can ``promote'' them to logical names in the current
process, which will then be inherited by all subprocesses,
by saying</P>
<PRE>
    foreach my $key (qw[C-local keys you want promoted]) {
       my $temp = $ENV{$key}; # read from C-local array
       $ENV{$key} = $temp;    # and define as logical name

Perl optimizer is smart enough to elide the expression.)</P>
<P>Don't try to clear <A HREF="#item_%ENV"><CODE>%ENV</CODE></A> by saying <A HREF="#item_%ENV"><CODE>%ENV = ();</CODE></A>, it will throw
a fatal error.  This is equivalent to doing the following from DCL:</P>
<PRE>
    DELETE/LOGICAL *</PRE>
<P>You can imagine how bad things would be if, for example, the SYS$MANAGER

<A HREF="../../lib/Pod/perlfunc.html#item_keys"><CODE>keys</CODE></A>, or <A HREF="../../lib/Pod/perlfunc.html#item_values"><CODE>values</CODE></A>,  you will incur a time penalty as all
logical names are read, in order to fully populate %ENV.
Subsequent iterations will not reread logical names, so they
won't be as slow, but they also won't reflect any changes
to logical name tables caused by other programs.</P>
<P>You do need to be careful with the logicals representing process-permanent
files, such as <CODE>SYS$INPUT</CODE> and <CODE>SYS$OUTPUT</CODE>.  The translations for these
logicals are prepended with a two-byte binary value (0x1B 0x00) that needs to be
