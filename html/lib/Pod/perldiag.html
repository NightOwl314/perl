<P>perldiag - various Perl diagnostics</P>
<P>
<HR>
<H1><A NAME="description">DESCRIPTION</A></H1>
<P>These messages are classified as follows (listed in increasing order of
desperation):</P>
<PRE>
    (W) A warning (optional).
    (D) A deprecation (optional).
    (S) A severe warning (default).
    (F) A fatal error (trappable).
    (P) An internal error you should never see (trappable).
    (X) A very fatal error (nontrappable).
    (A) An alien error message (not generated by Perl).</PRE>
<P>The majority of messages from the first three classifications above
(W, D &amp; S) can be controlled using the <CODE>warnings</CODE> pragma.</P>
<P>If a message can be controlled by the <CODE>warnings</CODE> pragma, its warning
category is included with the classification letter in the description
below.</P>
<P>Optional warnings are enabled by using the <CODE>warnings</CODE> pragma or the <STRONG>-w</STRONG>
and <STRONG>-W</STRONG> switches. Warnings may be captured by setting <CODE>$SIG{__WARN__}</CODE>
to a reference to a routine that will be called on each warning instead
of printing it.  See <A HREF="../../lib/Pod/perlvar.html">the perlvar manpage</A>.</P>
<P>Default warnings are always enabled unless they are explicitly disabled
with the <CODE>warnings</CODE> pragma or the <STRONG>-X</STRONG> switch.</P>
<P>Trappable errors may be trapped using the eval operator.  See
<A HREF="../../lib/Pod/perlfunc.html#eval">eval in the perlfunc manpage</A>.  In almost all cases, warnings may be selectively
disabled or promoted to fatal errors using the <CODE>warnings</CODE> pragma.
See <A HREF="../../lib/warnings.html">the warnings manpage</A>.</P>
<P>The messages are in alphabetical order, without regard to upper or
lower-case.  Some of these messages are generic.  Spots that vary are
denoted with a %s or other printf-style escape.  These escapes are
ignored by the alphabetical order, as are all characters other than
letters.  To look up your message, just ignore anything that is not a
letter.</P>
<DL>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_accept"><CODE>accept()</CODE> on closed socket %s</A></STRONG><BR>
<DD>
(W closed) You tried to do an accept on a closed socket.  Did you forget
to check the return value of your <A HREF="../../lib/Pod/perlfunc.html#item_socket"><CODE>socket()</CODE></A> call?  See
<A HREF="../../lib/Pod/perlfunc.html#accept">accept in the perlfunc manpage</A>.
<P></P>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_Allocation_too_large%3A_%25lx">Allocation too large: %lx</A></STRONG><BR>
<DD>
(X) You can't allocate more than 64K on an MS-DOS machine.
<P></P>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_%27%21%27_allowed_only_after_types_%25s">'!' allowed only after types %s</A></STRONG><BR>
<DD>
(F) The '!' is allowed in <A HREF="../../lib/Pod/perlfunc.html#item_pack"><CODE>pack()</CODE></A> and <A HREF="../../lib/Pod/perlfunc.html#item_unpack"><CODE>unpack()</CODE></A> only after certain types.
See <A HREF="../../lib/Pod/perlfunc.html#pack">pack in the perlfunc manpage</A>.
<P></P>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_s">Ambiguous call resolved as CORE::%s(), qualify as such or use &amp;</A></STRONG><BR>
<DD>
(W ambiguous) A subroutine you have declared has the same name as a Perl
keyword, and you have used the name without qualification for calling
one or the other.  Perl decided to call the builtin because the
subroutine is not imported.
<P>To force interpretation as a subroutine call, either put an ampersand
before the subroutine name, or qualify the name with its package.
Alternatively, you can import the subroutine (or pretend that it's
imported with the <CODE>use subs</CODE> pragma).</P>
<P>To silently interpret it as the Perl operator, use the <CODE>CORE::</CODE> prefix
on the operator (e.g. <A HREF="../../lib/Pod/perlfunc.html#item_log"><CODE>CORE::log($x)</CODE></A>) or by declaring the subroutine
to be an object method (see <A HREF="../../lib/Pod/perlsub.html#subroutine attributes">Subroutine Attributes in the perlsub manpage</A> or
<A HREF="../../lib/attributes.html">the attributes manpage</A>).</P>
<P></P>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_Ambiguous_use_of_%25s_resolved_as_%25s">Ambiguous use of %s resolved as %s</A></STRONG><BR>
<DD>
(W ambiguous)(S) You said something that may not be interpreted the way
you thought.  Normally it's pretty easy to disambiguate it by supplying
a missing quote, operator, parenthesis pair or declaration.
<P></P>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_%27%7C%27_and_%27%3C%27_may_not_both_be_specified_">'|' and '&lt;' may not both be specified on command line</A></STRONG><BR>
<DD>
(F) An error peculiar to VMS.  Perl does its own command line
redirection, and found that STDIN was a pipe, and that you also tried to
redirect STDIN using '&lt;'.  Only one STDIN stream to a customer, please.
<P></P>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_%27%7C%27_and_%27%3E%27_may_not_both_be_specified_">'|' and '&gt;' may not both be specified on command line</A></STRONG><BR>
<DD>
(F) An error peculiar to VMS.  Perl does its own command line
redirection, and thinks you tried to redirect stdout both to a file and
into a pipe to another command.  You need to choose one or the other,
though nothing's stopping you from piping into a program or Perl script
which 'splits' output into two streams, such as
<PRE>
    open(OUT,&quot;&gt;$ARGV[0]&quot;) or die &quot;Can't write to $ARGV[0]: $!&quot;;
    while (&lt;STDIN&gt;) {
        print;
        print OUT;
    }
    close OUT;</PRE>
<P></P>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_scalar">Applying %s to %s will act on <CODE>scalar(%s)</CODE></A></STRONG><BR>
<DD>
(W misc) The pattern match (//), substitution (s///), and
transliteration (tr///) operators work on scalar values.  If you apply
one of them to an array or a hash, it will convert the array or hash to
a scalar value -- the length of an array, or the population info of a
hash -- and then work on that scalar value.  This is probably not what
you meant to do.  See <A HREF="../../lib/Pod/perlfunc.html#grep">grep in the perlfunc manpage</A> and <A HREF="../../lib/Pod/perlfunc.html#map">map in the perlfunc manpage</A> for
alternatives.
<P></P>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_Args_must_match_%23%21_line">Args must match #! line</A></STRONG><BR>
<DD>
(F) The setuid emulator requires that the arguments Perl was invoked
with match the arguments specified on the #! line.  Since some systems
impose a one-argument limit on the #! line, try combining switches;
for example, turn <CODE>-w -U</CODE> into <CODE>-wU</CODE>.
<P></P>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_Arg_too_short_for_msgsnd">Arg too short for msgsnd</A></STRONG><BR>
<DD>
(F) <A HREF="../../lib/Pod/perlfunc.html#item_msgsnd"><CODE>msgsnd()</CODE></A> requires a string at least as long as sizeof(long).
<P></P>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_%s">%s argument is not a HASH or ARRAY element</A></STRONG><BR>
<DD>
(F) The argument to <A HREF="../../lib/Pod/perlfunc.html#item_exists"><CODE>exists()</CODE></A> must be a hash or array element, such as:
<PRE>
    $foo{$bar}
    $ref-&gt;{&quot;susie&quot;}[12]</PRE>
<P></P>
<DT><STRONG>%s argument is not a HASH or ARRAY element or slice</STRONG><BR>
<DD>
(F) The argument to <A HREF="../../lib/Pod/perlfunc.html#item_delete"><CODE>delete()</CODE></A> must be either a hash or array element,
such as:
<PRE>
    $foo{$bar}
    $ref-&gt;{&quot;susie&quot;}[12]</PRE>
<P>or a hash or array slice, such as:</P>
<PRE>
    @foo[$bar, $baz, $xyzzy]
    @{$ref-&gt;[12]}{&quot;susie&quot;, &quot;queue&quot;}</PRE>
<P></P>
<DT><STRONG>%s argument is not a subroutine name</STRONG><BR>
<DD>
(F) The argument to <A HREF="../../lib/Pod/perlfunc.html#item_exists"><CODE>exists()</CODE></A> for <CODE>exists &amp;sub</CODE> must be a subroutine
name, and not a subroutine call.  <A HREF="../../lib/Pod/perlfunc.html#item_sub"><CODE>exists &amp;sub()</CODE></A> will generate this
error.
<P></P>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_Argument_%22%25s%22_isn%27t_numeric%25s">Argument ``%s'' isn't numeric%s</A></STRONG><BR>
<DD>
(W numeric) The indicated string was fed as an argument to an operator
that expected a numeric value instead.  If you're fortunate the message
will identify which operator was so unfortunate.
<P></P>
<DT><STRONG>Array @%s missing the @ in argument %d of %s()</STRONG><BR>
<DD>
(D deprecated) Really old Perl let you omit the @ on array names in some
spots.  This is now heavily deprecated.
<P></P>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_assertion_botched%3A_%25s">assertion botched: %s</A></STRONG><BR>
<DD>
(P) The malloc package that comes with Perl had an internal failure.
<P></P>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_Assertion_failed%3A_file_%22%25s%22">Assertion failed: file ``%s''</A></STRONG><BR>
<DD>
(P) A general assertion failed.  The file in question must be examined.
<P></P>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_Assignment_to_both_a_list_and_a_scalar">Assignment to both a list and a scalar</A></STRONG><BR>
<DD>
(F) If you assign to a conditional operator, the 2nd and 3rd arguments
must either both be scalars or both be lists.  Otherwise Perl won't
know which context to supply to the right side.
<P></P>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_Negative_offset_to_vec_in_lvalue_context">Negative offset to vec in lvalue context</A></STRONG><BR>
<DD>
(F) When vec is called in an lvalue context, the second argument must be
greater than or equal to zero.
<P></P>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_Attempt_to_free_non%2Darena_SV%3A_0x%25lx">Attempt to free non-arena SV: 0x%lx</A></STRONG><BR>
<DD>
(P internal) All SV objects are supposed to be allocated from arenas
that will be garbage collected on exit.  An SV was discovered to be
outside any of those arenas.
<P></P>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_Attempt_to_free_nonexistent_shared_string">Attempt to free nonexistent shared string</A></STRONG><BR>
<DD>
(P internal) Perl maintains a reference counted internal table of
strings to optimize the storage and access of hash keys and other
strings.  This indicates someone tried to decrement the reference count
of a string that can no longer be found in the table.
<P></P>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_Attempt_to_free_temp_prematurely">Attempt to free temp prematurely</A></STRONG><BR>
<DD>
(W debugging) Mortalized values are supposed to be freed by the
<CODE>free_tmps()</CODE> routine.  This indicates that something else is freeing the
SV before the <CODE>free_tmps()</CODE> routine gets a chance, which means that the
<CODE>free_tmps()</CODE> routine will be freeing an unreferenced scalar when it does
try to free it.
<P></P>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_Attempt_to_free_unreferenced_glob_pointers">Attempt to free unreferenced glob pointers</A></STRONG><BR>
<DD>
(P internal) The reference counts got screwed up on symbol aliases.
<P></P>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_Attempt_to_free_unreferenced_scalar">Attempt to free unreferenced scalar</A></STRONG><BR>
<DD>
(W internal) Perl went to decrement the reference count of a scalar to
see if it would go to 0, and discovered that it had already gone to 0
earlier, and should have been freed, and in fact, probably was freed.
This could indicate that <CODE>SvREFCNT_dec()</CODE> was called too many times, or
that <CODE>SvREFCNT_inc()</CODE> was called too few times, or that the SV was
mortalized when it shouldn't have been, or that memory has been
corrupted.
<P></P>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_Attempt_to_join_self">Attempt to join self</A></STRONG><BR>
<DD>
(F) You tried to join a thread from within itself, which is an
impossible task.  You may be joining the wrong thread, or you may need
to move the <A HREF="../../lib/Pod/perlfunc.html#item_join"><CODE>join()</CODE></A> to some other thread.
<P></P>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_Attempt_to_pack_pointer_to_temporary_value">Attempt to pack pointer to temporary value</A></STRONG><BR>
<DD>
(W pack) You tried to pass a temporary value (like the result of a
function, or a computed expression) to the ``p'' <A HREF="../../lib/Pod/perlfunc.html#item_pack"><CODE>pack()</CODE></A> template.  This
means the result contains a pointer to a location that could become
invalid anytime, even before the end of the current statement.  Use
literals or global values as arguments to the ``p'' <A HREF="../../lib/Pod/perlfunc.html#item_pack"><CODE>pack()</CODE></A> template to
avoid this warning.
<P></P>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_Attempt_to_use_reference_as_lvalue_in_substr">Attempt to use reference as lvalue in substr</A></STRONG><BR>
<DD>
(W substr) You supplied a reference as the first argument to <A HREF="../../lib/Pod/perlvar.html#item_substr"><CODE>substr()</CODE></A>
used as an lvalue, which is pretty strange.  Perhaps you forgot to
dereference it first.  See <A HREF="../../lib/Pod/perlfunc.html#substr">substr in the perlfunc manpage</A>.
<P></P>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_Bad_arg_length_for_%25s%2C_is_%25d%2C_should_be_%2">Bad arg length for %s, is %d, should be %d</A></STRONG><BR>
<DD>
(F) You passed a buffer of the wrong size to one of msgctl(), <A HREF="../../lib/Pod/perlfunc.html#item_semctl"><CODE>semctl()</CODE></A>
or shmctl().  In C parlance, the correct sizes are, respectively,
sizeof(struct&nbsp;msqid_ds&nbsp;*), sizeof(struct&nbsp;semid_ds&nbsp;*), and
sizeof(struct&nbsp;shmid_ds&nbsp;*).
<P></P>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_Bad_evalled_substitution_pattern">Bad evalled substitution pattern</A></STRONG><BR>
<DD>
(F) You've used the /e switch to evaluate the replacement for a
substitution, but perl found a syntax error in the code to evaluate,
most likely an unexpected right brace '}'.
<P></P>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_Bad_filehandle%3A_%25s">Bad filehandle: %s</A></STRONG><BR>
<DD>
(F) A symbol was passed to something wanting a filehandle, but the
symbol has no filehandle associated with it.  Perhaps you didn't do an
open(), or did it in another package.
<P></P>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_free">Bad <CODE>free()</CODE> ignored</A></STRONG><BR>
<DD>
(S malloc) An internal routine called <A HREF="#item_free"><CODE>free()</CODE></A> on something that had never
been malloc()ed in the first place. Mandatory, but can be disabled by
setting environment variable <CODE>PERL_BADFREE</CODE> to 0.
<P>This message can be seen quite often with DB_File on systems with ``hard''
dynamic linking, like <CODE>AIX</CODE> and <A HREF="../../lib/Pod/perlrun.html#item_OS%2F2"><CODE>OS/2</CODE></A>. It is a bug of <CODE>Berkeley DB</CODE>
which is left unnoticed if <CODE>DB</CODE> uses <EM>forgiving</EM> system malloc().</P>
<P></P>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_Bad_hash">Bad hash</A></STRONG><BR>
<DD>
(P) One of the internal hash routines was passed a null HV pointer.
<P></P>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_Bad_index_while_coercing_array_into_hash">Bad index while coercing array into hash</A></STRONG><BR>
<DD>
(F) The index looked up in the hash found as the 0'th element of a
pseudo-hash is not legal.  Index values must be at 1 or greater.
See <A HREF="../../lib/Pod/perlref.html">the perlref manpage</A>.
<P></P>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_placed">Badly placed ()'s</A></STRONG><BR>
<DD>
(A) You've accidentally run your script through <STRONG>csh</STRONG> instead
of Perl.  Check the #! line, or manually feed your script into
Perl yourself.
<P></P>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_Bad_name_after_%25s%3A%3A">Bad name after %s::</A></STRONG><BR>
<DD>
(F) You started to name a symbol by using a package prefix, and then
didn't finish the symbol.  In particular, you can't interpolate outside
of quotes, so
<PRE>
    $var = 'myvar';
    $sym = mypack::$var;</PRE>
<P>is not the same as</P>
<PRE>
    $var = 'myvar';
    $sym = &quot;mypack::$var&quot;;</PRE>
<P></P>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_realloc">Bad <CODE>realloc()</CODE> ignored</A></STRONG><BR>
<DD>
(S malloc) An internal routine called <A HREF="#item_realloc"><CODE>realloc()</CODE></A> on something that had
never been malloc()ed in the first place. Mandatory, but can be disabled
by setting environment variable <CODE>PERL_BADFREE</CODE> to 1.
<P></P>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_Bad_symbol_for_array">Bad symbol for array</A></STRONG><BR>
<DD>
(P) An internal request asked to add an array entry to something that
wasn't a symbol table entry.
<P></P>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_Bad_symbol_for_filehandle">Bad symbol for filehandle</A></STRONG><BR>
<DD>
(P) An internal request asked to add a filehandle entry to something
that wasn't a symbol table entry.
<P></P>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_Bad_symbol_for_hash">Bad symbol for hash</A></STRONG><BR>
<DD>
(P) An internal request asked to add a hash entry to something that
wasn't a symbol table entry.
<P></P>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_Bareword_found_in_conditional">Bareword found in conditional</A></STRONG><BR>
<DD>
(W bareword) The compiler found a bareword where it expected a
conditional, which often indicates that an || or &amp;&amp; was parsed as part
of the last argument of the previous construct, for example:
<PRE>
    open FOO || die;</PRE>
<P>It may also indicate a misspelled constant that has been interpreted as
a bareword:</P>
<PRE>
    use constant TYPO =&gt; 1;
    if (TYOP) { print &quot;foo&quot; }</PRE>
<P>The <CODE>strict</CODE> pragma is useful in avoiding such errors.</P>
<P></P>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_Bareword_%22%25s%22_not_allowed_while_%22strict_su">Bareword ``%s'' not allowed while ``strict subs'' in use</A></STRONG><BR>
<DD>
(F) With ``strict subs'' in use, a bareword is only allowed as a
subroutine identifier, in curly brackets or to the left of the ``=&gt;''
symbol.  Perhaps you need to predeclare a subroutine?
<P></P>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_Bareword_%22%25s%22_refers_to_nonexistent_package">Bareword ``%s'' refers to nonexistent package</A></STRONG><BR>
<DD>
(W bareword) You used a qualified bareword of the form <CODE>Foo::</CODE>, but the
compiler saw no other uses of that namespace before that point.  Perhaps
you need to predeclare a package?
<P></P>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_BEGIN_failed%2D%2Dcompilation_aborted">BEGIN failed--compilation aborted</A></STRONG><BR>
<DD>
(F) An untrapped exception was raised while executing a BEGIN
subroutine.  Compilation stops immediately and the interpreter is
exited.
<P></P>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_BEGIN_not_safe_after_errors%2D%2Dcompilation_abort">BEGIN not safe after errors--compilation aborted</A></STRONG><BR>
<DD>
(F) Perl found a <CODE>BEGIN {}</CODE> subroutine (or a <A HREF="../../lib/Pod/perlfunc.html#item_use"><CODE>use</CODE></A> directive, which
implies a <CODE>BEGIN {}</CODE>) after one or more compilation errors had already
occurred.  Since the intended environment for the <CODE>BEGIN {}</CODE> could not
be guaranteed (due to the errors), and since subsequent code likely
depends on its correct operation, Perl just gave up.
<P></P>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_%5C1_better_written_as_%241">\1 better written as $1</A></STRONG><BR>
<DD>
(W syntax) Outside of patterns, backreferences live on as variables.
The use of backslashes is grandfathered on the right-hand side of a
substitution, but stylistically it's better to use the variable form
because other Perl programmers will expect it, and it works better if
there are more than 9 backreferences.
<P></P>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_Binary_number_%3E_0b111111111111111111111111111111">Binary number &gt; 0b11111111111111111111111111111111 non-portable</A></STRONG><BR>
<DD>
(W portable) The binary number you specified is larger than 2**32-1
(4294967295) and therefore non-portable between systems.  See
<A HREF="../../lib/Pod/perlport.html">the perlport manpage</A> for more on portability concerns.
<P></P>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_bind"><CODE>bind()</CODE> on closed socket %s</A></STRONG><BR>
<DD>
(W closed) You tried to do a bind on a closed socket.  Did you forget to
check the return value of your <A HREF="../../lib/Pod/perlfunc.html#item_socket"><CODE>socket()</CODE></A> call?  See <A HREF="../../lib/Pod/perlfunc.html#bind">bind in the perlfunc manpage</A>.
<P></P>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_Bit_vector_size_%3E_32_non%2Dportable">Bit vector size &gt; 32 non-portable</A></STRONG><BR>
<DD>
(W portable) Using bit vector sizes larger than 32 is non-portable.
<P></P>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_Bizarre_copy_of_%25s_in_%25s">Bizarre copy of %s in %s</A></STRONG><BR>
<DD>
(P) Perl detected an attempt to copy an internal value that is not
copyable.
<P></P>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_%2DP_not_allowed_for_setuid%2Fsetgid_script"><STRONG>-P</STRONG> not allowed for setuid/setgid script</A></STRONG><BR>
<DD>
(F) The script would have to be opened by the C preprocessor by name,
which provides a race condition that breaks security.
<P></P>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_Buffer_overflow_in_prime_env_iter%3A_%25s">Buffer overflow in prime_env_iter: %s</A></STRONG><BR>
<DD>
(W internal) A warning peculiar to VMS.  While Perl was preparing to
iterate over %ENV, it encountered a logical name or symbol definition
which was too long, so it was truncated to the string shown.
<P></P>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_Callback_called_exit">Callback called exit</A></STRONG><BR>
<DD>
(F) A subroutine invoked from an external package via <CODE>call_sv()</CODE>
exited by calling exit.
<P></P>
<DT><STRONG>%s() called too early to check prototype</STRONG><BR>
<DD>
(W prototype) You've called a function that has a prototype before the
parser saw a definition or declaration for it, and Perl could not check
that the call conforms to the prototype.  You need to either add an
early prototype declaration for the subroutine in question, or move the
subroutine definition ahead of the call to get proper prototype
checking.  Alternatively, if you are certain that you're calling the
function correctly, you may put an ampersand before the name to avoid
the warning.  See <A HREF="../../lib/Pod/perlsub.html">the perlsub manpage</A>.
<P></P>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_%2F_cannot_take_a_count">/ cannot take a count</A></STRONG><BR>
<DD>
(F) You had an unpack template indicating a counted-length string, but
you have also specified an explicit size for the string.  See
<A HREF="../../lib/Pod/perlfunc.html#pack">pack in the perlfunc manpage</A>.
<P></P>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_Can%27t_bless_non%2Dreference_value">Can't bless non-reference value</A></STRONG><BR>
<DD>
(F) Only hard references may be blessed.  This is how Perl ``enforces''
encapsulation of objects.  See <A HREF="../../lib/Pod/perlobj.html">the perlobj manpage</A>.
<P></P>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_Can%27t_call_method_%22%25s%22_in_empty_package_%2">Can't call method ``%s'' in empty package ``%s''</A></STRONG><BR>
<DD>
(F) You called a method correctly, and it correctly indicated a package
functioning as a class, but that package doesn't have ANYTHING defined
in it, let alone methods.  See <A HREF="../../lib/Pod/perlobj.html">the perlobj manpage</A>.
<P></P>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_Can%27t_call_method_%22%25s%22_on_an_undefined_val">Can't call method ``%s'' on an undefined value</A></STRONG><BR>
<DD>
(F) You used the syntax of a method call, but the slot filled by the
object reference or package name contains an undefined value.  Something
like this will reproduce the error:
<PRE>
    $BADREF = undef;
    process $BADREF 1,2,3;

<DD>
(S) A warning peculiar to VMS.  This arises because of the difference
between access checks under VMS and under the Unix model Perl assumes.
Under VMS, access checks are done by filename, rather than by bits in
the stat buffer, so that ACLs and other protections can be taken into
account.  Unfortunately, Perl assumes that the stat buffer contains all
the necessary information, and passes it, instead of the filespec, to
the access checking routine.  It will try to retrieve the filespec using
the device name and FID present in the stat buffer, but this works only
if you haven't made a subsequent call to the CRTL <A HREF="#item_stat"><CODE>stat()</CODE></A> routine,
because the device name is overwritten with each call.  If this warning
appears, the name lookup failed, and the access checking routine gave up
and returned FALSE, just to be conservative.  (Note: The access checking
routine knows about the Perl <A HREF="#item_stat"><CODE>stat</CODE></A> operator and file tests, so you
shouldn't ever see this warning in response to a Perl command; it arises
only if some internal code takes stat buffers lightly.)

(F) The deeply magical ``goto subroutine'' call can only replace one

(W signal) Perl has detected that it is being run with the SIGCHLD
signal (sometimes known as SIGCLD) disabled.  Since disabling this
signal will interfere with proper determination of exit status of child
processes, Perl has reset the signal to its default value.  This
situation typically indicates that the parent program under which Perl
may be running (e.g. cron) is being very careless.

(F) A ``last'' statement was executed to break out of the current block,
except that there's this itty bitty problem called there isn't a current

block, as doesn't a block given to sort(), <A HREF="../../lib/Pod/perlfunc.html#item_map"><CODE>map()</CODE></A> or grep().  You can

unless the file name included the full path to the file.  Perhaps you
need to set the PERL5LIB or PERL5OPT environment variable to say where

<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_Can%27t_redefine_active_sort_subroutine_%25s">Can't redefine active sort subroutine %s</A></STRONG><BR>
<DD>
(F) Perl optimizes the internal handling of sort subroutines and keeps
pointers into them.  You tried to redefine one such sort subroutine when
it was currently active, which is not allowed.  If you really want to do
this, you should write <CODE>sort { &amp;func } @x</CODE> instead of <CODE>sort func @x</CODE>.

<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_Can%27t_%22redo%22_outside_a_loop_block">Can't ``redo'' outside a loop block</A></STRONG><BR>
<DD>
(F) A ``redo'' statement was executed to restart the current block, but
there isn't a current block.  Note that an ``if'' or ``else'' block doesn't
count as a ``loopish'' block, as doesn't a block given to sort(), <A HREF="../../lib/Pod/perlfunc.html#item_map"><CODE>map()</CODE></A>
or grep().  You can usually double the curlies to get the same effect
though, because the inner curlies will be considered a block that
loops once.  See <A HREF="../../lib/Pod/perlfunc.html#redo">redo in the perlfunc manpage</A>.

<DT><STRONG>Can't reopen input pipe (name: %s) in binary mode</STRONG><BR>

<DD>
(F) You tried to return a complete array or hash from an lvalue subroutine,
but you called the subroutine in a way that made Perl think you meant

<DD>
(P) The internal sv_upgrade routine adds ``members'' to an SV, making it

specialized, however, that they cannot be interconverted.  This message
indicates that such a conversion was attempted.
<P></P>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_Can%27t_upgrade_to_undef">Can't upgrade to undef</A></STRONG><BR>

(P) The undefined SV is the bottom of the totem pole, in the scheme of

(F) The first time the %! hash is used, perl automatically loads the
Errno.pm module. The Errno module is expected to tie the %! hash to
provide symbolic names for <A HREF="../../lib/Pod/perlvar.html#item_%24%21"><CODE>$!</CODE></A> errno values.

<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_Can%27t_use_global_%25s_in_%22my%22">Can't use global %s in ``my''</A></STRONG><BR>
<DD>
(F) You tried to declare a magical variable as a lexical variable.  This
is not allowed, because the magic can be tied to only one location
(namely the global variable) and it would be incredibly confusing to
have variables in your program that looked like magical variables but
weren't.

Either qualify the sort variable with the package name, or rename the

<DD>
(W syntax) In an ordinary expression, backslash is a unary operator that
creates a reference to its argument.  The use of backslash to indicate a
backreference to a matched substring is valid only as part of a regular
expression pattern.  Trying to do this in ordinary Perl code produces a
value that prints out looking like SCALAR(0xdecaf).  Use the $1 form
instead.
<P></P>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_Can%27t_weaken_a_nonreference">Can't weaken a nonreference</A></STRONG><BR>

<DD>
(F) Perl could not compile a file specified in a <A HREF="../../lib/Pod/perlfunc.html#item_require"><CODE>require</CODE></A> statement.
Perl uses this generic message when none of the errors that it

<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_limit">Complex regular subexpression recursion limit (%d) exceeded</A></STRONG><BR>
<DD>
(W regexp) The regular expression engine uses recursion in complex
situations where back-tracking is required.  Recursion depth is limited
to 32766, or perhaps less in architectures where the stack cannot grow
arbitrarily.  (``Simple'' and ``medium'' situations are handled without
recursion and are not subject to a limit.)  Try shortening the string
under examination; looping in Perl code (e.g. with <CODE>while</CODE>) rather than
in the regular expression engine; or rewriting the regular expression so
that it is simpler or backtracks less.  (See <A HREF="../../lib/Pod/perlfaq2.html">the perlfaq2 manpage</A> for information
on <EM>Mastering Regular Expressions</EM>.)

because of ordering problems in your file, or because of a missing
``sub'', ``package'', ``require'', or ``use'' statement.  If you're referencing

<DD>
(S) The Perl lexer knows whether to expect a term or an operator.  If it
sees what it knows to be a term when it was expecting to see an

<A HREF="../../lib/Pod/perlfunc.html#item_glob"><CODE>glob</CODE></A> pattern that caused the external program to fail and exit with a
nonzero status.  If the message indicates that the abnormal exit
resulted in a coredump, this may also mean that your csh (C shell) is
broken.  If so, you should change all of the csh-related variables in
config.sh:  If you have tcsh, make the variables refer to it as if it
were csh (e.g.  <CODE>full_csh='/usr/bin/tcsh'</CODE>); otherwise, make them all
empty (except that <CODE>d_csh</CODE> should be <CODE>'undef'</CODE>) so that Perl will
think csh is missing.  In either case, after editing config.sh, run
<CODE>./Configure -S</CODE> and rebuild Perl.
<P></P>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_Glob_not_terminated">Glob not terminated</A></STRONG><BR>
<DD>
(F) The lexer saw a left angle bracket in a place where it was expecting
a term, so it's looking for the corresponding right angle bracket, and
not finding it.  Chances are you left some needed parentheses out
earlier in the line, and you really meant a ``less than''.

<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_Got_an_error_from_DosAllocMem">Got an error from DosAllocMem</A></STRONG><BR>

<P></P>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_Identifier_too_long">Identifier too long</A></STRONG><BR>

(F) Perl limits identifiers (names for variables, functions, etc.) to

offending digit.
<P></P>
<DT><STRONG>Illegal character %s (carriage return)</STRONG><BR>
<DD>
(F) Perl normally treats carriage returns in the program text as it
would any other whitespace, which means you should never see this error
when Perl was built using standard options.  For some reason, your
version of Perl appears to have been built without this support.  Talk
to your Perl administrator.
<P></P>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_Illegal_division_by_zero">Illegal division by zero</A></STRONG><BR>

(F) You tried to divide a number by 0.  Either something was wrong in

meaningless input.
<P></P>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_Illegal_hexadecimal_digit_%25s_ignored">Illegal hexadecimal digit %s ignored</A></STRONG><BR>

<P></P>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_Illegal_number_of_bits_in_vec">Illegal number of bits in vec</A></STRONG><BR>
<DD>
(F) The number of bits in <A HREF="../../lib/Pod/perlfunc.html#item_vec"><CODE>vec()</CODE></A> (the third argument) must be a power of
two from 1 to 32 (or 64, if your platform supports that).

<DD>
(W internal) A warning peculiar to VMS.  Perl tried to read a logical

didn't see the expected delimiter between key and value, so the line was
ignored.
<P></P>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_%28in_cleanup%29_%25s">(in cleanup) %s</A></STRONG><BR>
<DD>
(W misc) This prefix usually indicates that a <CODE>DESTROY()</CODE> method raised
the indicated exception.  Since destructors are usually called by the
system at arbitrary points during execution, and often a vast number of
times, the warning is issued only once for any number of failures that
would otherwise result in the same message being repeated.
<P>Failure of user callbacks dispatched using the <CODE>G_KEEPERR</CODE> flag could

The tainting mechanism is turned on when you're running setuid or

On a 32-bit architecture the largest hexadecimal, octal or binary number
representable without overflow is 0xFFFFFFFF, 037777777777, or
0b11111111111111111111111111111111 respectively.  Note that Perl
transparently promotes all numbers to a floating point representation

(S ambiguous) You used a variable or subroutine call where the parser
was expecting an operator.  The parser has assumed you really meant to
use an operator, but this is highly likely to be incorrect.  For
example, if you say ``*foo *foo'' it will be interpreted as if you said
``*foo * 'foo'''.

(F) The <CODE>malloc()</CODE> function returned 0, indicating there was insufficient

(X|F) The <CODE>malloc()</CODE> function returned 0, indicating there was
insufficient remaining memory (or virtual memory) to satisfy the

<P>The request was judged to be small, so the possibility to trap it
depends on the way perl was compiled.  By default it is not trappable.
However, if compiled for this, Perl may use the contents of <A HREF="../../lib/Pod/perlvar.html#item_%24%5EM"><CODE>$^M</CODE></A> as an

<DD>
(W syntax) You've used an array slice (indicated by @) to select a
single element of an array.  Generally it's better to ask for a scalar
value (indicated by $).  The difference is that <CODE>$foo[&amp;bar]</CODE> always
behaves like a scalar, both when assigning to it and when evaluating its

and provides a list context to its subscript, which can do weird things
if you're expecting only one subscript.
<P>On the other hand, if you were actually hoping to treat the array
element as a list, you need to look into how references work, because
Perl will not magically convert between scalars and lists for you.  See

This is the error message generally seen in a browser window when trying
to run a CGI program (including SSI) over the web. The actual error text
varies widely from server to server. The most frequently-seen variants
are ``500 Server error'', ``Method (something) not permitted'', ``Document
contains no data'', ``Premature end of script headers'', and ``Did not
produce a valid header''.
<P><STRONG>This is a CGI error, not a Perl error</STRONG>.</P>
<P>You need to make sure your script is executable, is accessible by the
user CGI is running the script under (which is probably not the user
account you tested it under), does not rely on any environment variables
(like PATH) from the user it isn't running under, and isn't in a
location where the CGI server can't find it, basically, more or less.

The error message itself often tells you where it was in the line when
it decided to give up.  Sometimes the actual error is several tokens
before this, because Perl is good at understanding random input.
Occasionally the line number may be misleading, and once in a blue moon
the only way to figure out what's triggering the error is to call
<CODE>perl -c</CODE> repeatedly, chopping away half the program each time to see
if the error went away.  Sort of the cybernetic version of 20

So Perl gives up.
<P>If the Perl script is being executed as a command using the #!

(F) The lexer found something other than a simple identifier at the
start of an attribute, and it wasn't a semicolon or the start of a
block.  Perhaps you terminated the parameter list of the previous
attribute too soon.  See <A HREF="../../lib/attributes.html">the attributes manpage</A>.

(F) The lexer saw an opening (left) parenthesis character while parsing
an attribute list, but the matching closing (right) parenthesis
character was not found.  You may need to add (or remove) a backslash
character to get your parentheses to balance.  See <A HREF="../../lib/attributes.html">the attributes manpage</A>.

(F) An argument to <A HREF="../../lib/Pod/perlfunc.html#item_unpack"><CODE>unpack(``w'',...)</CODE></A> was incompatible with the BER
compressed integer format and could not be converted to an integer.

<DD>
(F) The lexer saw a left angle bracket in a place where it was expecting
a term, so it's looking for the corresponding right angle bracket, and
not finding it.  Chances are you left some needed parentheses out
earlier in the line, and you really meant a ``less than''.

<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_untie_attempted_while_%25d_inner_references_still_">untie attempted while %d inner references still exist</A></STRONG><BR>

(W untie) A copy of the object returned from <A HREF="../../lib/Pod/perlfunc.html#item_tie"><CODE>tie</CODE></A> (or <A HREF="../../lib/Pod/perlfunc.html#item_tied"><CODE>tied</CODE></A>) was

<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_Useless_use_of_%25s_in_void_context">Useless use of %s in void context</A></STRONG><BR>
<DD>
(W void) You did something without a side effect in a context that does
nothing with the return value, such as a statement that doesn't return a
value from a block, or the left side of a scalar comma operator.  Very
often this points not to stupidity on your part, but a failure of Perl
to parse your program the way you thought it would.  For example, you'd
get this if you mixed up your C precedence with Python precedence and
said
<PRE>
    $one, $two = 1, 2;</PRE>
<P>when you meant to say</P>
<PRE>
    ($one, $two) = (1, 2);</PRE>
<P>Another common error is to use ordinary parentheses to construct a list
reference when you should be using square or curly brackets, for
example, if you say</P>
<PRE>
    $array = (1,2);</PRE>
<P>when you should have said</P>
<PRE>
    $array = [1,2];</PRE>
<P>The square brackets explicitly turn a list value into a scalar value,
while parentheses do not.  So when a parenthesized list is evaluated in
a scalar context, the comma is treated like C's comma operator, which
throws away the left argument, which is not what you want.  See
<A HREF="../../lib/Pod/perlref.html">the perlref manpage</A> for more on this.</P>

(D deprecated) It makes a lot of work for the compiler when you clobber
a subroutine's argument list, so it's better if you assign the results

<P></P>
<DT><STRONG>Use of inherited AUTOLOAD for non-method %s() is deprecated</STRONG><BR>
<DD>
(D deprecated) As an (ahem) accidental feature, <CODE>AUTOLOAD</CODE> subroutines
are looked up as methods (using the <CODE>@ISA</CODE> hierarchy) even when the
subroutines to be autoloaded were called as plain functions (e.g.
<CODE>Foo::bar()</CODE>), not as methods (e.g. <CODE>Foo-&gt;bar()</CODE> or <CODE>&lt;
$obj-</CODE><CODE>bar()</CODE> &gt;&gt;).
<P>This bug will be rectified in future by using method lookup only for
methods' <CODE>AUTOLOAD</CODE>s.  However, there is a significant base of existing
code that may be using the old behavior.  So, as an interim step, Perl
currently issues an optional warning when non-methods use inherited
<CODE>AUTOLOAD</CODE>s.</P>
<P>The simple rule is:  Inheritance will not work when autoloading
non-methods.  The simple fix for old code is:  In any module that used
to depend on inheriting <CODE>AUTOLOAD</CODE> for non-methods from a base class
named <CODE>BaseClass</CODE>, execute <CODE>*AUTOLOAD = \&amp;BaseClass::AUTOLOAD</CODE> during
startup.</P>
<P>In code that currently says <A HREF="#item_qw"><CODE>use AutoLoader; @ISA = qw(AutoLoader);</CODE></A>
you should remove AutoLoader from @ISA and change <CODE>use AutoLoader;</CODE> to
<CODE>use AutoLoader 'AUTOLOAD';</CODE>.</P>

(D deprecated) This variable magically turned on multi-line pattern
matching, both for you and for any luckless subroutine that you happen
to call.  You should use the new <CODE>//m</CODE> and <CODE>//s</CODE> modifiers now to do
that without the dangerous action-at-a-distance effects of <A HREF="../../lib/Pod/perlvar.html#item_%24%2A"><CODE>$*</CODE></A>.

<P></P>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_Use_of_%24%23_is_deprecated">Use of $# is deprecated</A></STRONG><BR>

<DD>
(D deprecated) The indicated bareword is a reserved word.  Future
versions of perl may use it as a keyword, so you're better off either
explicitly quoting the word in a manner appropriate for its context of
use, or using a different name altogether.  The warning can be
suppressed for subroutine names by either adding a <CODE>&amp;</CODE> prefix, or using
a package qualifier, e.g. <A HREF="../../lib/Pod/perlfunc.html#item_our"><CODE>&amp;our()</CODE></A>, or <A HREF="../../lib/Pod/perlfunc.html#item_our"><CODE>Foo::our()</CODE></A>.
<P></P>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_Use_of_uninitialized_value%25s">Use of uninitialized value%s</A></STRONG><BR>

(W uninitialized) An undefined value was used as if it were already
defined.  It was interpreted as a ``'' or a 0, but maybe it was a mistake.
To suppress this warning assign a defined value to your variables.
<P>To help you figure out what was undefined, perl tells you what operation
you used the undefined value in.  Note, however, that perl optimizes your
program and the operation displayed in the warning may not necessarily
appear literally in your program.  For example, <CODE>&quot;that $foo&quot;</CODE> is
usually optimized into <CODE>&quot;that &quot; . $foo</CODE>, and the warning will refer to
the <CODE>concatenation (.)</CODE> operator, even though there is no <CODE>.</CODE> in your
program.</P>
<P></P>
<DT><STRONG>Value of %s can be ``0''; test with <CODE>defined()</CODE></STRONG><BR>

(W misc) In a conditional expression, you used &lt;HANDLE&gt;, &lt;*&gt; (glob),
<A HREF="../../lib/Pod/perlfunc.html#item_each"><CODE>each()</CODE></A>, or <A HREF="../../lib/Pod/perlfunc.html#item_readdir"><CODE>readdir()</CODE></A> as a boolean value.  Each of these constructs
can return a value of ``0''; that would make the conditional expression
false, which is probably not what you intended.  When using these
constructs in conditional expressions, test their values with the
<A HREF="#item_defined"><CODE>defined</CODE></A> operator.

(W misc) A warning peculiar to VMS.  Perl tried to read the value of an

longer than 1024 characters.  The return value has been truncated to
1024 characters.

(F) While ``use strict'' in effect, you referred to a global variable that
you apparently thought was imported from another module, because
something else of the same name (usually a subroutine) is exported by
that module.  It usually means you put the wrong funny character on the
front of your variable.

(W misc) A ``my'' or ``our'' variable has been redeclared in the current
scope or statement, effectively eliminating all access to the previous

earlier variable will still exist until the end of the scope or until
all closure referents to it are destroyed.

<DD>
(W closure) An inner (nested) <EM>anonymous</EM> subroutine is inside a
<EM>named</EM> subroutine, and outside that is another subroutine; and the
anonymous (innermost) subroutine is referencing a lexical variable
defined in the outermost subroutine.  For example:
<PRE>
   sub outermost { my $a; sub middle { sub { $a } } }</PRE>
<P>If the anonymous subroutine is called or referenced (directly or
indirectly) from the outermost subroutine, it will share the variable as
you would expect.  But if the anonymous subroutine is called or
referenced when the outermost subroutine is not active, it will see the
value of the shared variable as it was before and during the *first*
call to the outermost subroutine, which is probably not what you want.</P>
<P>In these circumstances, it is usually best to make the middle subroutine
anonymous, using the <A HREF="../../lib/Pod/perlfunc.html#item_sub"><CODE>sub {}</CODE></A> syntax.  Perl has specific support for

(W closure) An inner (nested) <EM>named</EM> subroutine is referencing a
lexical variable defined in an outer subroutine.
<P>When the inner subroutine is called, it will probably see the value of
the outer subroutine's variable as it was before and during the *first*
call to the outer subroutine; in this case, after the first call to the
outer subroutine is complete, the inner and outer subroutines will no
longer share a common value for the variable.  In other words, the
variable will no longer be shared.</P>
<P>Furthermore, if the outer subroutine is anonymous and references a
lexical variable outside itself, then the outer and inner subroutines
will <EM>never</EM> share the given variable.</P>
<P>This problem can usually be solved by making the inner subroutine
anonymous, using the <A HREF="../../lib/Pod/perlfunc.html#item_sub"><CODE>sub {}</CODE></A> syntax.  When inner anonymous subs that
reference variables in outer subroutines are called or referenced, they
are automatically rebound to the current values of such variables.</P>
