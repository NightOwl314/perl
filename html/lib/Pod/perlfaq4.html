<H1><A NAME="name">NAME</A></H1>
<P>perlfaq4 - Data Manipulation ($Revision: 1.49 $, $Date: 1999/05/23 20:37:49 $)</P>
<P>
<HR>
<H1><A NAME="description">DESCRIPTION</A></H1>
<P>The section of the FAQ answers questions related to the manipulation
of data as numbers, dates, strings, arrays, hashes, and miscellaneous
data issues.</P>
<P>
<HR>
<H1><A NAME="data: numbers">Data: Numbers</A></H1>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="why am i getting long decimals (eg, 19.9499999999999) instead of the numbers i should be getting (eg, 19.95)">Why am I getting long decimals (eg, 19.9499999999999) instead of the numbers I should be getting (eg, 19.95)?</A></H2>
<P>The infinite set that a mathematician thinks of as the real numbers can
only be approximated on a computer, since the computer only has a finite
number of bits to store an infinite number of, um, numbers.</P>
<P>Internally, your computer represents floating-point numbers in binary.
Floating-point numbers read in from a file or appearing as literals
in your program are converted from their decimal floating-point
representation (eg, 19.95) to an internal binary representation.</P>
<P>However, 19.95 can't be precisely represented as a binary
floating-point number, just like 1/3 can't be exactly represented as a
decimal floating-point number.  The computer's binary representation
of 19.95, therefore, isn't exactly 19.95.</P>
<P>When a floating-point number gets printed, the binary floating-point
representation is converted back to decimal.  These decimal numbers
are displayed in either the format you specify with printf(), or the
current output format for numbers.  (See <A HREF="../../lib/Pod/perlvar.html#$#">$# in the perlvar manpage</A> if you use
print.  <A HREF="../../lib/Pod/perlvar.html#item_%24%23"><CODE>$#</CODE></A> has a different default value in Perl5 than it did in
Perl4.  Changing <A HREF="../../lib/Pod/perlvar.html#item_%24%23"><CODE>$#</CODE></A> yourself is deprecated.)</P>
<P>This affects <STRONG>all</STRONG> computer languages that represent decimal
floating-point numbers in binary, not just Perl.  Perl provides
arbitrary-precision decimal numbers with the Math::BigFloat module
(part of the standard Perl distribution), but mathematical operations
are consequently slower.</P>
<P>To get rid of the superfluous digits, just use a format (eg,
<A HREF="../../lib/Pod/perlfunc.html#item_printf"><CODE>printf(&quot;%.2f&quot;, 19.95)</CODE></A>) to get the required precision.
See <A HREF="../../lib/Pod/perlop.html#floatingpoint arithmetic">Floating-point Arithmetic in the perlop manpage</A>.</P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="why isn't my octal data interpreted correctly">Why isn't my octal data interpreted correctly?</A></H2>
<P>Perl only understands octal and hex numbers as such when they occur
as literals in your program.  If they are read in from somewhere and
assigned, no automatic conversion takes place.  You must explicitly
use <A HREF="../../lib/Pod/perlfunc.html#item_oct"><CODE>oct()</CODE></A> or <A HREF="../../lib/Pod/perlfunc.html#item_hex"><CODE>hex()</CODE></A> if you want the values converted.  <A HREF="../../lib/Pod/perlfunc.html#item_oct"><CODE>oct()</CODE></A> interprets
both hex (``0x350'') numbers and octal ones (``0350'' or even without the
leading ``0'', like ``377''), while <A HREF="../../lib/Pod/perlfunc.html#item_hex"><CODE>hex()</CODE></A> only converts hexadecimal ones,
with or without a leading ``0x'', like ``0x255'', ``3A'', ``ff'', or ``deadbeef''.</P>
<P>This problem shows up most often when people try using chmod(), mkdir(),
umask(), or sysopen(), which all want permissions in octal.</P>
<PRE>
    chmod(644,  $file); # WRONG -- perl -w catches this
    chmod(0644, $file); # right</PRE>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="does perl have a round() function what about ceil() and floor() trig functions">Does Perl have a <CODE>round()</CODE> function?  What about <CODE>ceil()</CODE> and floor()?  Trig functions?</A></H2>
<P>Remember that <A HREF="../../lib/Pod/perlfunc.html#item_int"><CODE>int()</CODE></A> merely truncates toward 0.  For rounding to a
certain number of digits, <A HREF="../../lib/Pod/perlfunc.html#item_sprintf"><CODE>sprintf()</CODE></A> or <A HREF="../../lib/Pod/perlfunc.html#item_printf"><CODE>printf()</CODE></A> is usually the easiest
route.</P>
<PRE>
    printf(&quot;%.3f&quot;, 3.1415926535);       # prints 3.142</PRE>
<P>The POSIX module (part of the standard Perl distribution) implements
ceil(), floor(), and a number of other mathematical and trigonometric
functions.</P>
<PRE>
    use POSIX;
    $ceil   = ceil(3.5);                        # 4
    $floor  = floor(3.5);                       # 3</PRE>
<P>In 5.000 to 5.003 perls, trigonometry was done in the Math::Complex
module.  With 5.004, the Math::Trig module (part of the standard Perl
distribution) implements the trigonometric functions. Internally it
uses the Math::Complex module and some functions can break out from
the real axis into the complex plane, for example the inverse sine of
2.</P>
<P>Rounding in financial applications can have serious implications, and
the rounding method used should be specified precisely.  In these
cases, it probably pays not to trust whichever system rounding is
being used by Perl, but to instead implement the rounding function you
need yourself.</P>
<P>To see why, notice how you'll still have an issue on half-way-point
alternation:</P>
<PRE>
    for ($i = 0; $i &lt; 1.01; $i += 0.05) { printf &quot;%.1f &quot;,$i}</PRE>
<PRE>
    0.0 0.1 0.1 0.2 0.2 0.2 0.3 0.3 0.4 0.4 0.5 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.7 
    0.8 0.8 0.9 0.9 1.0 1.0</PRE>
<P>Don't blame Perl.  It's the same as in C.  IEEE says we have to do this.
Perl numbers whose absolute values are integers under 2**31 (on 32 bit
machines) will work pretty much like mathematical integers.  Other numbers
are not guaranteed.</P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="how do i convert bits into ints">How do I convert bits into ints?</A></H2>
<P>To turn a string of 1s and 0s like <CODE>10110110</CODE> into a scalar containing
its binary value, use the <A HREF="../../lib/Pod/perlfunc.html#item_pack"><CODE>pack()</CODE></A> and <A HREF="../../lib/Pod/perlfunc.html#item_unpack"><CODE>unpack()</CODE></A> functions (documented in
<A HREF="../../lib/Pod/perlfunc.html#pack">pack in the perlfunc manpage</A> and <A HREF="../../lib/Pod/perlfunc.html#unpack">unpack in the perlfunc manpage</A>):</P>
<PRE>
    $decimal = unpack('c', pack('B8', '10110110'));</PRE>
<P>This packs the string <CODE>10110110</CODE> into an eight bit binary structure.
This is then unpacked as a character, which returns its ordinal value.</P>
<P>This does the same thing:</P>
<PRE>
    $decimal = ord(pack('B8', '10110110'));</PRE>
<P>Here's an example of going the other way:</P>
<PRE>
    $binary_string = unpack('B*', &quot;\x29&quot;);</PRE>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="why doesn't & work the way i want it to">Why doesn't &amp; work the way I want it to?</A></H2>
<P>The behavior of binary arithmetic operators depends on whether they're
used on numbers or strings.  The operators treat a string as a series
of bits and work with that (the string <CODE>&quot;3&quot;</CODE> is the bit pattern
<CODE>00110011</CODE>).  The operators work with the binary form of a number
(the number <CODE>3</CODE> is treated as the bit pattern <CODE>00000011</CODE>).</P>
<P>So, saying <CODE>11 &amp; 3</CODE> performs the ``and'' operation on numbers (yielding
<CODE>1</CODE>).  Saying <CODE>&quot;11&quot; &amp; &quot;3&quot;</CODE> performs the ``and'' operation on strings
(yielding <CODE>&quot;1&quot;</CODE>).</P>
<P>Most problems with <CODE>&amp;</CODE> and <CODE>|</CODE> arise because the programmer thinks
they have a number but really it's a string.  The rest arise because
the programmer says:</P>
<PRE>
    if (&quot;\020\020&quot; &amp; &quot;\101\101&quot;) {
        # ...
    }</PRE>
<P>but a string consisting of two null bytes (the result of <CODE>&quot;\020\020&quot;
&amp; &quot;\101\101&quot;</CODE>) is not a false value in Perl.  You need:</P>
<PRE>
    if ( (&quot;\020\020&quot; &amp; &quot;\101\101&quot;) !~ /[^\000]/) {
        # ...
    }</PRE>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="how do i multiply matrices">How do I multiply matrices?</A></H2>
<P>Use the Math::Matrix or Math::MatrixReal modules (available from CPAN)
or the PDL extension (also available from CPAN).</P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="how do i perform an operation on a series of integers">How do I perform an operation on a series of integers?</A></H2>
<P>To call a function on each element in an array, and collect the
results, use:</P>
<PRE>
    @results = map { my_func($_) } @array;</PRE>
<P>For example:</P>
<PRE>
    @triple = map { 3 * $_ } @single;</PRE>
<P>To call a function on each element of an array, but ignore the
results:</P>
<PRE>
    foreach $iterator (@array) {
        some_func($iterator);
    }</PRE>
<P>To call a function on each integer in a (small) range, you <STRONG>can</STRONG> use:</P>
<PRE>
    @results = map { some_func($_) } (5 .. 25);</PRE>
<P>but you should be aware that the <CODE>..</CODE> operator creates an array of
all integers in the range.  This can take a lot of memory for large
ranges.  Instead use:</P>
<PRE>
    @results = ();
    for ($i=5; $i &lt; 500_005; $i++) {
        push(@results, some_func($i));
    }</PRE>
<P>This situation has been fixed in Perl5.005. Use of <CODE>..</CODE> in a <CODE>for</CODE>
loop will iterate over the range, without creating the entire range.</P>
<PRE>
    for my $i (5 .. 500_005) {
        push(@results, some_func($i));
    }</PRE>
<P>will not create a list of 500,000 integers.</P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="how can i output roman numerals">How can I output Roman numerals?</A></H2>
<P>Get the <A HREF="http://www.perl.com/CPAN/modules/by-module/Roman">http://www.perl.com/CPAN/modules/by-module/Roman</A> module.</P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="why aren't my random numbers random">Why aren't my random numbers random?</A></H2>
<P>If you're using a version of Perl before 5.004, you must call <A HREF="../../lib/Pod/perlfunc.html#item_srand"><CODE>srand</CODE></A>
once at the start of your program to seed the random number generator.
5.004 and later automatically call <A HREF="../../lib/Pod/perlfunc.html#item_srand"><CODE>srand</CODE></A> at the beginning.  Don't
call <A HREF="../../lib/Pod/perlfunc.html#item_srand"><CODE>srand</CODE></A> more than once--you make your numbers less random, rather
than more.</P>
<P>Computers are good at being predictable and bad at being random
(despite appearances caused by bugs in your programs :-).
<A HREF="http://www.perl.com/CPAN/doc/FMTEYEWTK/random">http://www.perl.com/CPAN/doc/FMTEYEWTK/random</A> , courtesy of Tom
Phoenix, talks more about this.  John von Neumann said, ``Anyone who
attempts to generate random numbers by deterministic means is, of
course, living in a state of sin.''</P>
<P>If you want numbers that are more random than <A HREF="../../lib/Pod/perlfunc.html#item_rand"><CODE>rand</CODE></A> with <A HREF="../../lib/Pod/perlfunc.html#item_srand"><CODE>srand</CODE></A>
provides, you should also check out the Math::TrulyRandom module from
CPAN.  It uses the imperfections in your system's timer to generate
random numbers, but this takes quite a while.  If you want a better
pseudorandom generator than comes with your operating system, look at
``Numerical Recipes in C'' at <A HREF="http://www.nr.com/">http://www.nr.com/</A> .</P>
<P>
<HR>
<H1><A NAME="data: dates">Data: Dates</A></H1>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="how do i find the weekoftheyear/dayoftheyear">How do I find the week-of-the-year/day-of-the-year?</A></H2>
<P>The day of the year is in the array returned by <A HREF="../../lib/Pod/perlfunc.html#item_localtime"><CODE>localtime()</CODE></A> (see
<A HREF="../../lib/Pod/perlfunc.html#localtime">localtime in the perlfunc manpage</A>):</P>
<PRE>
    $day_of_year = (localtime(time()))[7];</PRE>
<P>or more legibly (in 5.004 or higher):</P>
<PRE>
    use Time::localtime;
    $day_of_year = localtime(time())-&gt;yday;</PRE>
<P>You can find the week of the year by dividing this by 7:</P>
<PRE>
    $week_of_year = int($day_of_year / 7);</PRE>
<P>Of course, this believes that weeks start at zero.  The Date::Calc
module from CPAN has a lot of date calculation functions, including
day of the year, week of the year, and so on.   Note that not
all businesses consider ``week 1'' to be the same; for example,
American businesses often consider the first week with a Monday
in it to be Work Week #1, despite ISO 8601, which considers
WW1 to be the first week with a Thursday in it.</P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="how do i find the current century or millennium">How do I find the current century or millennium?</A></H2>
<P>Use the following simple functions:</P>
<PRE>
    sub get_century    { 
        return int((((localtime(shift || time))[5] + 1999))/100);
    } 
    sub get_millennium { 
        return 1+int((((localtime(shift || time))[5] + 1899))/1000);
    }</PRE>
<P>On some systems, you'll find that the POSIX module's <CODE>strftime()</CODE> function
has been extended in a non-standard way to use a <CODE>%C</CODE> format, which they
sometimes claim is the ``century''.  It isn't, because on most such systems,
this is only the first two digits of the four-digit year, and thus cannot

<H2><A NAME="how can i compare two dates and find the difference">How can I compare two dates and find the difference?</A></H2>
<P>If you're storing your dates as epoch seconds then simply subtract one
from the other.  If you've got a structured date (distinct year, day,
month, hour, minute, seconds values), then for reasons of accessibility,
simplicity, and efficiency, merely use either timelocal or timegm (from
the Time::Local module in the standard distribution) to reduce structured
dates to epoch seconds.  However, if you don't know the precise format of
your dates, then you should probably use either of the Date::Manip and
Date::Calc modules from CPAN before you go hacking up your own parsing
routine to handle arbitrary date formats.</P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="how can i take a string and turn it into epoch seconds">How can I take a string and turn it into epoch seconds?</A></H2>
<P>If it's a regular enough string that it always has the same format,
you can split it up and pass the parts to <CODE>timelocal</CODE> in the standard
Time::Local module.  Otherwise, you should look into the Date::Calc
and Date::Manip modules from CPAN.</P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="how can i find the julian day">How can I find the Julian Day?</A></H2>
<P>Use the Time::JulianDay module (part of the Time-modules bundle
available from CPAN.)</P>
<P>Before you immerse yourself too deeply in this, be sure to verify that it
is the <EM>Julian</EM> Day you really want.  Are you really just interested in
a way of getting serial days so that they can do date arithmetic?  If you
are interested in performing date arithmetic, this can be done using
either Date::Manip or Date::Calc, without converting to Julian Day first.</P>
<P>There is too much confusion on this issue to cover in this FAQ, but the
term is applied (correctly) to a calendar now supplanted by the Gregorian
Calendar, with the Julian Calendar failing to adjust properly for leap
years on centennial years (among other annoyances).  The term is also used
(incorrectly) to mean: [1] days in the Gregorian Calendar; and [2] days
since a particular starting time or `epoch', usually 1970 in the Unix
world and 1980 in the MS-DOS/Windows world.  If you find that it is not
the first meaning that you really want, then check out the Date::Manip
and Date::Calc modules.  (Thanks to David Cassell for most of this text.)</P>

<H2><A NAME="how do i find yesterday's date">How do I find yesterday's date?</A></H2>
<P>The <A HREF="../../lib/Pod/perlfunc.html#item_time"><CODE>time()</CODE></A> function returns the current time in seconds since the
epoch.  Take twenty-four hours off that:</P>
<PRE>
    $yesterday = time() - ( 24 * 60 * 60 );</PRE>
<P>Then you can pass this to <A HREF="../../lib/Pod/perlfunc.html#item_localtime"><CODE>localtime()</CODE></A> and get the individual year,
month, day, hour, minute, seconds values.</P>
<P>Note very carefully that the code above assumes that your days are
twenty-four hours each.  For most people, there are two days a year
when they aren't: the switch to and from summer time throws this off.
A solution to this issue is offered by Russ Allbery.</P>
<PRE>
    sub yesterday {
        my $now  = defined $_[0] ? $_[0] : time;
        my $then = $now - 60 * 60 * 24;
        my $ndst = (localtime $now)[8] &gt; 0;
        my $tdst = (localtime $then)[8] &gt; 0;
        $then - ($tdst - $ndst) * 60 * 60;
    }
    # Should give you &quot;this time yesterday&quot; in seconds since epoch relative to
    # the first argument or the current time if no argument is given and
    # suitable for passing to localtime or whatever else you need to do with
    # it.  $ndst is whether we're currently in daylight savings time; $tdst is
    # whether the point 24 hours ago was in daylight savings time.  If $tdst
    # and $ndst are the same, a boundary wasn't crossed, and the correction
    # will subtract 0.  If $tdst is 1 and $ndst is 0, subtract an hour more
    # from yesterday's time since we gained an extra hour while going off
    # daylight savings time.  If $tdst is 0 and $ndst is 1, subtract a
    # negative hour (add an hour) to yesterday's time since we lost an hour.
    #
    # All of this is because during those days when one switches off or onto
    # DST, a &quot;day&quot; isn't 24 hours long; it's either 23 or 25.
    #
    # The explicit settings of $ndst and $tdst are necessary because localtime
    # only says it returns the system tm struct, and the system tm struct at
    # least on Solaris doesn't guarantee any particular positive value (like,
    # say, 1) for isdst, just a positive value.  And that value can
    # potentially be negative, if DST information isn't available (this sub
    # just treats those cases like no DST).
    #
    # Note that between 2am and 3am on the day after the time zone switches
    # off daylight savings time, the exact hour of &quot;yesterday&quot; corresponding
    # to the current hour is not clearly defined.  Note also that if used
    # between 2am and 3am the day after the change to daylight savings time,
    # the result will be between 3am and 4am of the previous day; it's
    # arguable whether this is correct.
    #
    # This sub does not attempt to deal with leap seconds (most things don't).

<H2><A NAME="does perl have a year 2000 problem is perl y2k compliant">Does Perl have a Year 2000 problem?  Is Perl Y2K compliant?</A></H2>
<P>Short answer: No, Perl does not have a Year 2000 problem.  Yes, Perl is
Y2K compliant (whatever that means).  The programmers you've hired to
use it, however, probably are not.</P>
<P>Long answer: The question belies a true understanding of the issue.
Perl is just as Y2K compliant as your pencil--no more, and no less.
Can you use your pencil to write a non-Y2K-compliant memo?  Of course
you can.  Is that the pencil's fault?  Of course it isn't.</P>
<P>The date and time functions supplied with Perl (gmtime and localtime)
supply adequate information to determine the year well beyond 2000
(2038 is when trouble strikes for 32-bit machines).  The year returned
by these functions when used in a list context is the year minus 1900.
For years between 1910 and 1999 this <EM>happens</EM> to be a 2-digit decimal
number. To avoid the year 2000 problem simply do not treat the year as
a 2-digit number.  It isn't.</P>
<P>When <A HREF="../../lib/Pod/perlfunc.html#item_gmtime"><CODE>gmtime()</CODE></A> and <A HREF="../../lib/Pod/perlfunc.html#item_localtime"><CODE>localtime()</CODE></A> are used in scalar context they return
a timestamp string that contains a fully-expanded year.  For example,
<A HREF="../../lib/Pod/perlfunc.html#item_gmtime"><CODE>$timestamp = gmtime(1005613200)</CODE></A> sets $timestamp to ``Tue Nov 13 01:00:00
2001''.  There's no year 2000 problem here.</P>
<P>That doesn't mean that Perl can't be used to create non-Y2K compliant
programs.  It can.  But so can your pencil.  It's the fault of the user,
not the language.  At the risk of inflaming the NRA: ``Perl doesn't
break Y2K, people do.''  See <A HREF="http://language.perl.com/news/y2k.html">http://language.perl.com/news/y2k.html</A> for
a longer exposition.</P>

<H2><A NAME="how do i find matching/nesting anything">How do I find matching/nesting anything?</A></H2>
<P>This isn't something that can be done in one regular expression, no
matter how complicated.  To find something between two single
characters, a pattern like <A HREF="../../lib/Pod/perlguts.html#item_x"><CODE>/x([^x]*)x/</CODE></A> will get the intervening
bits in $1. For multiple ones, then something more like
<CODE>/alpha(.*?)omega/</CODE> would be needed.  But none of these deals with
nested patterns, nor can they.  For that you'll have to write a
parser.</P>
<P>If you are serious about writing a parser, there are a number of
modules or oddities that will make your life a lot easier.  There are
the CPAN modules Parse::RecDescent, Parse::Yapp, and Text::Balanced;
and the byacc program.</P>
<P>One simple destructive, inside-out approach that you might try is to

<H2><A NAME="how can i count the number of occurrences of a substring within a string">How can I count the number of occurrences of a substring within a string?</A></H2>

    $count = ($string =~ tr/X//);
    print &quot;There are $count X characters in the string&quot;;</PRE>
<P>This is fine if you are just looking for a single character.  However,
if you are trying to count multiple character substrings within a
larger string, <A HREF="../../lib/Pod/perlfunc.html#item_tr/"><CODE>tr///</CODE></A> won't work.  What you can do is wrap a <CODE>while()</CODE>
loop around a global pattern match.  For example, let's count negative
integers:</P>
<PRE>
    $string = &quot;-9 55 48 -2 23 -76 4 14 -44&quot;;

<P>Take the example case of trying to split a string that is comma-separated

<P>Due to the restriction of the quotes, this is a fairly complex
problem.  Thankfully, we have Jeffrey Friedl, author of a highly

<P>(This answer contributed by Uri Guttman, with kibitzing from
Bart Lateur.)</P>
<P>In the following examples, <CODE>$pad_len</CODE> is the length to which you wish
to pad the string, <CODE>$text</CODE> or <CODE>$num</CODE> contains the string to be padded,
and <CODE>$pad_char</CODE> contains the padding character. You can use a single
character string constant instead of the <CODE>$pad_char</CODE> variable if you
know what it is in advance. And in the same way you can use an integer in
place of <CODE>$pad_len</CODE> if you know the pad length in advance.</P>
<P>The simplest method uses the <A HREF="../../lib/Pod/perlfunc.html#item_sprintf"><CODE>sprintf</CODE></A> function. It can pad on the left
or right with blanks and on the left with zeroes and it will not
truncate the result. The <A HREF="../../lib/Pod/perlfunc.html#item_pack"><CODE>pack</CODE></A> function can only pad strings on the
right with blanks and it will truncate the result to a maximum length of
<CODE>$pad_len</CODE>.</P>

    # Left padding a string with blanks (no truncation):
    $padded = sprintf(&quot;%${pad_len}s&quot;, $text);</PRE>

<PRE>
    # Right padding a string with blanks using pack (will truncate):
    $padded = pack(&quot;A$pad_len&quot;,$text);</PRE>
<P>If you need to pad with a character other than blank or zero you can use
one of the following methods.  They all generate a pad string with the
<A HREF="../../lib/Pod/perlguts.html#item_x"><CODE>x</CODE></A> operator and combine that with <CODE>$text</CODE>. These methods do
not truncate <CODE>$text</CODE>.</P>
<P>Left and right padding with any character, creating a new string:</P>

two words which you might want to appear separately.  For example, the
last names `Knuth' and `Kant' are both mapped to the soundex code K530.
If Text::Soundex does not do what you are looking for, you might want
to consider the String::Approx module available at CPAN.</P>

<H2><A NAME="how can i expand variables in text strings">How can I expand variables in text strings?</A></H2>
<P>Let's assume that you have a string like:</P>
<PRE>
    $text = 'this has a $foo in it and a $bar';</PRE>
<P>If those were both global variables, then this would
suffice:</P>
<PRE>
    $text =~ s/\$(\w+)/${$1}/g;  # no /e needed</PRE>
<P>But since they are probably lexicals, or at least, they could
be, you'd have to do this:</P>
<PRE>
    $text =~ s/(\$\w+)/$1/eeg;
    die if $@;                  # needed /ee, not /e</PRE>
<P>It's probably better in the general case to treat those
variables as entries in some special hash.  For example:</P>
<PRE>
    %user_defs = ( 
        foo  =&gt; 23,
        bar  =&gt; 19,
    );
    $text =~ s/\$(\w+)/$user_defs{$1}/g;</PRE>

<P>
<H2><A NAME="what's wrong with always quoting $vars">What's wrong with always quoting ``$vars''?</A></H2>
<P>The problem is that those double-quotes force stringification--
coercing numbers and references into strings--even when you
don't want them to be strings.  Think of it this way: double-quote
expansion is used to produce new strings.  If you already 
have a string, why do you need more?</P>
<P>If you get used to writing odd things like these:</P>
<PRE>
    print &quot;$var&quot;;       # BAD
    $new = &quot;$old&quot;;      # BAD
    somefunc(&quot;$var&quot;);   # BAD</PRE>
<P>You'll be in trouble.  Those should (in 99.8% of the cases) be
the simpler and more direct:</P>
<PRE>
    print $var;
    $new = $old;
    somefunc($var);</PRE>
<P>Otherwise, besides slowing you down, you're going to break code when
the thing in the scalar is actually neither a string nor a number, but
a reference:</P>

that actually do care about the difference between a string and a
number, such as the magical <CODE>++</CODE> autoincrement operator or the
<A HREF="../../lib/Pod/perlfunc.html#item_syscall"><CODE>syscall()</CODE></A> function.</P>
<P>Stringification also destroys arrays.</P>

<P>
<H2><A NAME="what is the difference between a list and an array">What is the difference between a list and an array?</A></H2>
<P>An array has a changeable length.  A list does not.  An array is something
you can push or pop, while a list is a set of values.  Some people make
the distinction that a list is a value while an array is a variable.
Subroutines are passed and return lists, you put things into list
context, you initialize arrays with lists, and you <CODE>foreach()</CODE> across
a list.  <CODE>@</CODE> variables are arrays, anonymous arrays are arrays, arrays
in scalar context behave like the number of elements in them, subroutines
access their arguments through the array <A HREF="../../lib/Pod/perlvar.html#item_%40_"><CODE>@_</CODE></A>, and push/pop/shift only work
on arrays.</P>
<P>As a side note, there's no such thing as a list in scalar context.
When you say</P>
<PRE>
    $scalar = (2, 5, 7, 9);</PRE>
<P>you're using the comma operator in scalar context, so it uses the scalar
comma operator.  There never was a list there at all!  This causes the
last value to be returned: 9.</P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="what is the difference between $array[1] and @array[1]">What is the difference between $array[1] and @array[1]?</A></H2>
<P>The former is a scalar value; the latter an array slice, making
it a list with one (scalar) value.  You should use $ when you want a
scalar value (most of the time) and @ when you want a list with one
scalar value in it (very, very rarely; nearly never, in fact).</P>
<P>Sometimes it doesn't make a difference, but sometimes it does.
For example, compare:</P>
<PRE>
    $good[0] = `some program that outputs several lines`;</PRE>
<P>with</P>
<PRE>
    @bad[0]  = `same program that outputs several lines`;</PRE>

matters.</P>

<H2><A NAME="how can i remove duplicate elements from a list or array">How can I remove duplicate elements from a list or array?</A></H2>

If @in is sorted, and you want @out to be sorted:

<PRE>
    $prev = &quot;not equal to $in[0]&quot;;
    @out = grep($_ ne $prev &amp;&amp; ($prev = $_, 1), @in);</PRE>
<P>This is nice in that it doesn't use much extra memory, simulating
uniq(1)'s behavior of removing only adjacent duplicates.  The ``, 1''
guarantees that the expression is true (so that grep picks it up)
even if the $_ is 0, ``'', or undef.</P>

<P>
<H2><A NAME="how can i tell whether a list or array contains a certain element">How can I tell whether a list or array contains a certain element?</A></H2>
<P>Hearing the word ``in'' is an <EM>in</EM>dication that you probably should have
used a hash, not a list or array, to store your data.  Hashes are
designed to answer this question quickly and efficiently.  Arrays aren't.</P>
<P>That being said, there are several ways to approach this.  If you
are going to make this query many times over arbitrary string values,
the fastest way is probably to invert the original array and keep an
associative array lying about whose keys are the first array's values.</P>
<PRE>
    @blues = qw/azure cerulean teal turquoise lapis-lazuli/;
    undef %is_blue;
    for (@blues) { $is_blue{$_} = 1 }</PRE>
<P>Now you can check whether $is_blue{$some_color}.  It might have been a
good idea to keep the blues all in a hash in the first place.</P>
<P>If the values are all small integers, you could use a simple indexed
array.  This kind of an array will take up less space:</P>
<PRE>
    @primes = (2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31);
    undef @is_tiny_prime;
    for (@primes) { $is_tiny_prime[$_] = 1 }
    # or simply  @istiny_prime[@primes] = (1) x @primes;</PRE>
<P>Now you check whether $is_tiny_prime[$some_number].</P>
<P>If the values in question are integers instead of strings, you can save
quite a lot of space by using bit strings instead:</P>
<PRE>
    @articles = ( 1..10, 150..2000, 2017 );
    undef $read;
    for (@articles) { vec($read,$_,1) = 1 }</PRE>
<P>Now check whether <A HREF="../../lib/Pod/perlfunc.html#item_vec"><CODE>vec($read,$n,1)</CODE></A> is true for some <CODE>$n</CODE>.</P>

<PRE>
    ($is_there) = grep $_ eq $whatever, @array;</PRE>
<P>or worse yet</P>
<PRE>
    ($is_there) = grep /$whatever/, @array;</PRE>
<P>These are slow (checks every element even if the first matches),
inefficient (same reason), and potentially buggy (what if there are
regex characters in $whatever?).  If you're only testing once, then
use:</P>
<PRE>
    $is_there = 0;
    foreach $elt (@array) {
        if ($elt eq $elt_to_find) {
            $is_there = 1;

<PRE>
    @union = @intersection = @difference = ();
    %count = ();

        push @union, $element;
        push @{ $count{$element} &gt; 1 ? \@intersection : \@difference }, $element;
    }</PRE>
<P>Note that this is the <EM>symmetric difference</EM>, that is, all elements in
either A or in B but not in both.  Think of it as an xor operation.</P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="how do i test whether two arrays or hashes are equal">How do I test whether two arrays or hashes are equal?</A></H2>
<P>The following code works for single-level arrays.  It uses a stringwise

strings.  Modify if you have other needs.</P>
<PRE>
    $are_equal = compare_arrays(\@frogs, \@toads);</PRE>

    sub compare_arrays {

            return 0 if $first-&gt;[$i] ne $second-&gt;[$i];
        }
        return 1;
    }</PRE>
<P>For multilevel structures, you may wish to use an approach more
like this one.  It uses the CPAN module FreezeThaw:</P>
<PRE>
    use FreezeThaw qw(cmpStr);
    @a = @b = ( &quot;this&quot;, &quot;that&quot;, [ &quot;more&quot;, &quot;stuff&quot; ] );</PRE>
<PRE>
    printf &quot;a and b contain %s arrays\n&quot;,
        cmpStr(\@a, \@b) == 0 
            ? &quot;the same&quot; 
            : &quot;different&quot;;</PRE>
<P>This approach also works for comparing hashes.  Here
we'll demonstrate two different answers:</P>
<PRE>
    use FreezeThaw qw(cmpStr cmpStrHard);</PRE>
<PRE>
    %a = %b = ( &quot;this&quot; =&gt; &quot;that&quot;, &quot;extra&quot; =&gt; [ &quot;more&quot;, &quot;stuff&quot; ] );
    $a{EXTRA} = \%b;
    $b{EXTRA} = \%a;</PRE>
<PRE>
    printf &quot;a and b contain %s hashes\n&quot;,
        cmpStr(\%a, \%b) == 0 ? &quot;the same&quot; : &quot;different&quot;;</PRE>
<PRE>
    printf &quot;a and b contain %s hashes\n&quot;,
        cmpStrHard(\%a, \%b) == 0 ? &quot;the same&quot; : &quot;different&quot;;</PRE>
<P>The first reports that both those the hashes contain the same data,
while the second reports that they do not.  Which you prefer is left as
an exercise to the reader.</P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="how do i find the first array element for which a condition is true">How do I find the first array element for which a condition is true?</A></H2>
<P>You can use this if you care about the index:</P>

        if ($array[$i] eq &quot;Waldo&quot;) {
            $found_index = $i;

<P>Now <CODE>$found_index</CODE> has what you want.</P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="how do i handle linked lists">How do I handle linked lists?</A></H2>
<P>In general, you usually don't need a linked list in Perl, since with
regular arrays, you can push and pop or shift and unshift at either end,
or you can use splice to add and/or remove arbitrary number of elements at
arbitrary points.  Both pop and shift are both <CODE>O(1)</CODE> operations on Perl's
dynamic arrays.  In the absence of shifts and pops, push in general
needs to reallocate on the order every <A HREF="../../lib/Pod/perlfunc.html#item_log"><CODE>log(N)</CODE></A> times, and unshift will
need to copy pointers each time.</P>
<P>If you really, really wanted, you could use structures as described in
<A HREF="../../lib/Pod/perldsc.html">the perldsc manpage</A> or <A HREF="../../lib/Pod/perltoot.html">the perltoot manpage</A> and do just what the algorithm book tells you
to do.  For example, imagine a list node like this:</P>
<PRE>
    $node = {
        VALUE =&gt; 42,
        LINK  =&gt; undef,
    };</PRE>
<P>You could walk the list this way:</P>
<PRE>
    print &quot;List: &quot;;
    for ($node = $head;  $node; $node = $node-&gt;{LINK}) {
        print $node-&gt;{VALUE}, &quot; &quot;;
    }
    print &quot;\n&quot;;</PRE>
<P>You could add to the list this way:</P>
<PRE>
    my ($head, $tail);
    $tail = append($head, 1);       # grow a new head
    for $value ( 2 .. 10 ) {
        $tail = append($tail, $value);
    }</PRE>
<PRE>
    sub append {
        my($list, $value) = @_;
        my $node = { VALUE =&gt; $value };
        if ($list) {
            $node-&gt;{LINK} = $list-&gt;{LINK};
            $list-&gt;{LINK} = $node;
        } else {
            $_[0] = $node;      # replace caller's version
        }

<P>Supply a comparison function to <A HREF="../../lib/Pod/perlfunc.html#item_sort"><CODE>sort()</CODE></A> (described in <A HREF="../../lib/Pod/perlfunc.html#sort">sort in the perlfunc manpage</A>):</P>
<PRE>
    @list = sort { $a &lt;=&gt; $b } @list;</PRE>
<P>The default sort function is cmp, string comparison, which would
sort <CODE>(1, 2, 10)</CODE> into <CODE>(1, 10, 2)</CODE>.  <CODE>&lt;=&gt;</CODE>, used above, is
the numerical comparison operator.</P>
<P>If you have a complicated function needed to pull out the part you
want to sort on, then don't do it inside the sort function.  Pull it
out first, because the sort BLOCK can be called many times for the
same element.  Here's an example of how to pull out the first word
after the first number on each item, and then sort those words
case-insensitively.</P>
<PRE>
    @idx = ();
    for (@data) {
        ($item) = /\d+\s*(\S+)/;
        push @idx, uc($item);
    }
    @sorted = @data[ sort { $idx[$a] cmp $idx[$b] } 0 .. $#idx ];</PRE>
<P>which could also be written this way, using a trick
that's come to be known as the Schwartzian Transform:</P>
<PRE>
    @sorted = map  { $_-&gt;[0] }
              sort { $a-&gt;[1] cmp $b-&gt;[1] }
              map  { [ $_, uc( (/\d+\s*(\S+)/)[0]) ] } @data;</PRE>
<P>If you need to sort on several fields, the following paradigm is useful.</P>
<PRE>
    @sorted = sort { field1($a) &lt;=&gt; field1($b) ||
                     field2($a) cmp field2($b) ||
                     field3($a) cmp field3($b)
                   }     @data;</PRE>
<P>This can be conveniently combined with precalculation of keys as given
above.</P>

<P>The short story is that you should probably only use defined on scalars or
functions, not on aggregates (arrays and hashes).  See <A HREF="../../lib/Pod/perlfunc.html#defined">defined in the perlfunc manpage</A>
in the 5.004 release or later of Perl for more detail.</P>

<P>Use the <A HREF="../../lib/Pod/perlfunc.html#item_each"><CODE>each()</CODE></A> function (see <A HREF="../../lib/Pod/perlfunc.html#each">each in the perlfunc manpage</A>) if you don't care
whether it's sorted:</P>
<PRE>
    while ( ($key, $value) = each %hash) {
        print &quot;$key = $value\n&quot;;

<P>If you want it sorted, you'll have to use <CODE>foreach()</CODE> on the result of
sorting the keys as shown in an earlier question.</P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="what happens if i add or remove keys from a hash while iterating over it">What happens if I add or remove keys from a hash while iterating over it?</A></H2>
<P>Don't do that. :-)</P>
<P>[lwall] In Perl 4, you were not allowed to modify a hash at all while
iterating over it.  In Perl 5 you can delete from it, but you still
can't add to it, because that might cause a doubling of the hash table,
in which half the entries get copied up to the new top half of the
table, at which point you've totally bamboozled the iterator code.
Even if the table doesn't double, there's no telling whether your new
entry will be inserted before or after the current iterator position.</P>
<P>Either treasure up your changes and make them after the iterator finishes
or use keys to fetch all the old keys at once, and iterate over the list
of keys.</P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="how do i look up a hash element by value">How do I look up a hash element by value?</A></H2>
<P>Create a reverse hash:</P>
<PRE>
    %by_value = reverse %by_key;
    $key = $by_value{$value};</PRE>
<P>That's not particularly efficient.  It would be more space-efficient
to use:</P>
<PRE>
    while (($key, $value) = each %by_key) {
        $by_value{$value} = $key;
    }</PRE>
<P>If your hash could have repeated values, the methods above will only find
one of the associated keys.   This may or may not worry you.  If it does
worry you, you can always reverse the hash into a hash of arrays instead:</P>
<PRE>
     while (($key, $value) = each %by_key) {
         push @{$key_list_by_value{$value}}, $key;

<H2><A NAME="how can i know how many entries are in a hash">How can I know how many entries are in a hash?</A></H2>
<P>If you mean how many keys, then all you have to do is
take the scalar sense of the <A HREF="../../lib/Pod/perlfunc.html#item_keys"><CODE>keys()</CODE></A> function:</P>
<PRE>
    $num_keys = scalar keys %hash;</PRE>
<P>The <A HREF="../../lib/Pod/perlfunc.html#item_keys"><CODE>keys()</CODE></A> function also resets the iterator, which in void context is
faster for tied hashes than would be iterating through the whole 
hash, one key-value pair at a time.</P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="how do i sort a hash (optionally by value instead of key)">How do I sort a hash (optionally by value instead of key)?</A></H2>
<P>Internally, hashes are stored in a way that prevents you from imposing
an order on key-value pairs.  Instead, you have to sort a list of the
keys or values:</P>
<PRE>
    @keys = sort keys %hash;    # sorted by key
    @keys = sort {
                    $hash{$a} cmp $hash{$b}
            } keys %hash;       # and by value</PRE>
<P>Here we'll do a reverse numeric sort by value, and if two keys are
identical, sort by length of key, or if that fails, by straight ASCII
comparison of the keys (well, possibly modified by your locale--see
<A HREF="../../lib/Pod/perllocale.html">the perllocale manpage</A>).</P>
<PRE>
    @keys = sort {

<H2><A NAME="what's the difference between delete and undef with hashes">What's the difference between ``delete'' and ``undef'' with hashes?</A></H2>
<P>Hashes are pairs of scalars: the first is the key, the second is the

any kind of scalar: string, number, or reference.  If a key <CODE>$key</CODE> is
present in the array, <A HREF="../../lib/Pod/perlfunc.html#item_exists"><CODE>exists($key)</CODE></A> will return true.  The value for
a given key can be <A HREF="../../lib/Pod/perlfunc.html#item_undef"><CODE>undef</CODE></A>, in which case <CODE>$array{$key}</CODE> will be
<A HREF="../../lib/Pod/perlfunc.html#item_undef"><CODE>undef</CODE></A> while <CODE>$exists{$key}</CODE> will return true.  This corresponds to
(<CODE>$key</CODE>, <A HREF="../../lib/Pod/perlfunc.html#item_undef"><CODE>undef</CODE></A>) being in the hash.</P>

<P>They may or may not implement the <CODE>EXISTS()</CODE> and <CODE>DEFINED()</CODE> methods
differently.  For example, there isn't the concept of undef with hashes

that exists and defined do the same thing with a DBM* file, and what

isn't a C float.  The <CODE>is_numeric</CODE> function is a front end to <CODE>getnum</CODE>
if you just want to say, ``Is this a float?''</P>
<PRE>
    sub getnum {
        use POSIX qw(strtod);
        my $str = shift;
        $str =~ s/^\s+//;
        $str =~ s/\s+$//;
        $! = 0;
        my($num, $unparsed) = strtod($str);
        if (($str eq '') || ($unparsed != 0) || $!) {
            return undef;
        } else {
            return $num;
        } 
    }</PRE>
<PRE>
    sub is_numeric { defined getnum($_[0]) }</PRE>
<P>Or you could check out the String::Scanf module on CPAN instead.  The
POSIX module (part of the standard Perl distribution) provides the
<CODE>strtod</CODE> and <CODE>strtol</CODE> for converting strings to double and longs,
respectively.</P>

<P>For some specific applications, you can use one of the DBM modules.
See <A HREF="../../lib/AnyDBM_File.html">the AnyDBM_File manpage</A>.  More generically, you should consult the FreezeThaw,
Storable, or Class::Eroot modules from CPAN.  Here's one example using
Storable's <CODE>store</CODE> and <CODE>retrieve</CODE> functions:</P>
<PRE>
    use Storable; 
    store(\%hash, &quot;filename&quot;);</PRE>
<PRE>
    # later on...  
    $href = retrieve(&quot;filename&quot;);        # by ref
    %hash = %{ retrieve(&quot;filename&quot;) };   # direct to hash</PRE>

<H2><A NAME="how do i print out or copy a recursive data structure">How do I print out or copy a recursive data structure?</A></H2>
<P>The Data::Dumper module on CPAN (or the 5.005 release of Perl) is great
for printing out data structures.  The Storable module, found on CPAN,
provides a function called <CODE>dclone</CODE> that recursively copies its argument.</P>
<PRE>
    use Storable qw(dclone); 
    $r2 = dclone($r1);</PRE>
<P>Where $r1 can be a reference to any kind of data structure you'd like.
It will be deeply copied.  Because <CODE>dclone</CODE> takes and returns references,
you'd have to add extra punctuation if you had a hash of arrays that
you wanted to copy.</P>
<PRE>
    %newhash = %{ dclone(\%oldhash) };</PRE>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="how do i define methods for every class/object">How do I define methods for every class/object?</A></H2>
<P>Use the UNIVERSAL class (see <A HREF="../../lib/UNIVERSAL.html">the UNIVERSAL manpage</A>).</P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="how do i verify a credit card checksum">How do I verify a credit card checksum?</A></H2>
<P>Get the Business::CreditCard module from CPAN.</P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="how do i pack arrays of doubles or floats for xs code">How do I pack arrays of doubles or floats for XS code?</A></H2>
<P>The kgbpack.c code in the PGPLOT module on CPAN does just this.
If you're doing a lot of float or double processing, consider using
the PDL module from CPAN instead--it makes number-crunching easy.</P>
