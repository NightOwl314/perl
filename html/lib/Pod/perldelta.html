<P>perldelta - what's new for perl v5.6.x</P>
<P>
<HR>
<H1><A NAME="description">DESCRIPTION</A></H1>
<P>This document describes differences between the 5.005 release and the 5.6.1
release.</P>
<P>
<HR>
<H1><A NAME="summary of changes between 5.6.0 and 5.6.1">Summary of changes between 5.6.0 and 5.6.1</A></H1>
<P>This section contains a summary of the changes between the 5.6.0 release
and the 5.6.1 release.  More details about the changes mentioned here
may be found in the <EM>Changes</EM> files that accompany the Perl source
distribution.  See <A HREF="../../lib/Pod/perlhack.html">the perlhack manpage</A> for pointers to online resources where you
can inspect the individual patches described by these changes.</P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="security issues">Security Issues</A></H2>
<P>suidperl will not run /bin/mail anymore, because some platforms have
a /bin/mail that is vulnerable to buffer overflow attacks.</P>
<P>Note that suidperl is neither built nor installed by default in
any recent version of perl.  Use of suidperl is highly discouraged.
If you think you need it, try alternatives such as sudo first.
See <A HREF="http://www.courtesan.com/sudo/.">http://www.courtesan.com/sudo/.</A></P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="core bug fixes">Core bug fixes</A></H2>
<P>This is not an exhaustive list.  It is intended to cover only the
significant user-visible changes.</P>
<DL>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_isa"><CODE>UNIVERSAL::isa()</CODE></A></STRONG><BR>
<DD>
A bug in the caching mechanism used by <A HREF="#item_isa"><CODE>UNIVERSAL::isa()</CODE></A> that affected
base.pm has been fixed.  The bug has existed since the 5.005 releases,
but wasn't tickled by base.pm in those releases.
<P></P>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_Memory_leaks">Memory leaks</A></STRONG><BR>
<DD>
Various cases of memory leaks and attempts to access uninitialized memory
have been cured.  See <A HREF="#known problems">Known Problems</A> below for further issues.
<P></P>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_Numeric_conversions">Numeric conversions</A></STRONG><BR>
<DD>
Numeric conversions did not recognize changes in the string value
properly in certain circumstances.
<P>In other situations, large unsigned numbers (those above 2**31) could
sometimes lose their unsignedness, causing bogus results in arithmetic
operations.</P>
<P>Integer modulus on large unsigned integers sometimes returned
incorrect values.</P>
<P>Perl 5.6.0 generated ``not a number'' warnings on certain conversions where
previous versions didn't.</P>
<P>These problems have all been rectified.</P>
<P>Infinity is now recognized as a number.</P>
<P></P>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_qw"><CODE>qw(a\\b)</CODE></A></STRONG><BR>
<DD>
In Perl 5.6.0, <A HREF="#item_qw"><CODE>qw(a\\b)</CODE></A> produced a string with two backslashes instead
of one, in a departure from the behavior in previous versions.  The
older behavior has been reinstated.
<P></P>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_caller"><CODE>caller()</CODE></A></STRONG><BR>
<DD>
<A HREF="#item_caller"><CODE>caller()</CODE></A> could cause core dumps in certain situations.  Carp was sometimes
affected by this problem.
<P></P>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_Bugs_in_regular_expressions">Bugs in regular expressions</A></STRONG><BR>
<DD>
Pattern matches on overloaded values are now handled correctly.
<P>Perl 5.6.0 parsed m/\x{ab}/ incorrectly, leading to spurious warnings.
This has been corrected.</P>
<P>The RE engine found in Perl 5.6.0 accidentally pessimised certain kinds
of simple pattern matches.  These are now handled better.</P>
<P>Regular expression debug output (whether through <CODE>use re 'debug'</CODE>
or via <CODE>-Dr</CODE>) now looks better.</P>
<P>Multi-line matches like <CODE>&quot;a\nxb\n&quot; =~ /(?!\A)x/m</CODE> were flawed.  The
bug has been fixed.</P>
<P>Use of $&amp; could trigger a core dump under some situations.  This
is now avoided.</P>
<P>Match variables $1 et al., weren't being unset when a pattern match
was backtracking, and the anomaly showed up inside <CODE>/...(?{ ... }).../</CODE>
etc.  These variables are now tracked correctly.</P>
<P><A HREF="../../lib/Pod/perlfunc.html#item_pos"><CODE>pos()</CODE></A> did not return the correct value within s///ge in earlier
versions.  This is now handled correctly.</P>
<P></P>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_%22slurp%22_mode">``slurp'' mode</A></STRONG><BR>
<DD>
<A HREF="../../lib/Pod/perlfunc.html#item_readline"><CODE>readline()</CODE></A> on files opened in ``slurp'' mode could return an extra ``'' at
the end in certain situations.  This has been corrected.
<P></P>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_Autovivification_of_symbolic_references_to_special">Autovivification of symbolic references to special variables</A></STRONG><BR>
<DD>
Autovivification of symbolic references of special variables described
in <A HREF="../../lib/Pod/perlvar.html">the perlvar manpage</A> (as in <CODE>${$num}</CODE>) was accidentally disabled.  This works
again now.
<P></P>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_Lexical_warnings">Lexical warnings</A></STRONG><BR>
<DD>
Lexical warnings now propagate correctly into <CODE>eval &quot;...&quot;</CODE>.
<P><A HREF="#item_qw"><CODE>use warnings qw(FATAL all)</CODE></A> did not work as intended.  This has been
corrected.</P>
<P>Lexical warnings could leak into other scopes in some situations.
This is now fixed.</P>
<P>warnings::enabled() now reports the state of $^W correctly if the caller
isn't using lexical warnings.</P>
<P></P>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_Spurious_warnings_and_errors">Spurious warnings and errors</A></STRONG><BR>
<DD>
Perl 5.6.0 could emit spurious warnings about redefinition of <CODE>dl_error()</CODE>
when statically building extensions into perl.  This has been corrected.
<P>``our'' variables could result in bogus ``Variable will not stay shared''
warnings.  This is now fixed.</P>
<P>``our'' variables of the same name declared in two sibling blocks
resulted in bogus warnings about ``redeclaration'' of the variables.
The problem has been corrected.</P>
<P></P>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_glob"><CODE>glob()</CODE></A></STRONG><BR>
<DD>
Compatibility of the builtin <A HREF="#item_glob"><CODE>glob()</CODE></A> with old csh-based glob has been
improved with the addition of GLOB_ALPHASORT option.  See <A HREF="#item_File%3A%3AGlob"><CODE>File::Glob</CODE></A>.
<P>File::Glob::glob() has been renamed to File::Glob::bsd_glob()
because the name clashes with the builtin glob().  The older
name is still available for compatibility, but is deprecated.</P>
<P>Spurious syntax errors generated in certain situations, when <A HREF="#item_glob"><CODE>glob()</CODE></A>
caused File::Glob to be loaded for the first time, have been fixed.</P>
<P></P>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_Tainting">Tainting</A></STRONG><BR>
<DD>
Some cases of inconsistent taint propagation (such as within hash
values) have been fixed.
<P>The tainting behavior of <A HREF="../../lib/Pod/perlfunc.html#item_sprintf"><CODE>sprintf()</CODE></A> has been rationalized.  It does
not taint the result of floating point formats anymore, making the
behavior consistent with that of string interpolation.</P>
<P></P>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_sort"><CODE>sort()</CODE></A></STRONG><BR>
<DD>
Arguments to <A HREF="#item_sort"><CODE>sort()</CODE></A> weren't being provided the right <A HREF="../../lib/Pod/perlfunc.html#item_wantarray"><CODE>wantarray()</CODE></A> context.
The comparison block is now run in scalar context, and the arguments to
be sorted are always provided list context.
<P><A HREF="#item_sort"><CODE>sort()</CODE></A> is also fully reentrant, in the sense that the sort function
can itself call sort().  This did not work reliably in previous releases.</P>
<P></P>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_%23line_directives">#line directives</A></STRONG><BR>
<DD>
#line directives now work correctly when they appear at the very
beginning of <CODE>eval &quot;...&quot;</CODE>.
<P></P>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_Subroutine_prototypes">Subroutine prototypes</A></STRONG><BR>
<DD>
The (\&amp;) prototype now works properly.
<P></P>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_map"><CODE>map()</CODE></A></STRONG><BR>
<DD>
<A HREF="#item_map"><CODE>map()</CODE></A> could get pathologically slow when the result list it generates
is larger than the source list.  The performance has been improved for
common scenarios.
<P></P>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_Debugger">Debugger</A></STRONG><BR>
<DD>
Debugger exit code now reflects the script exit code.
<P>Condition <CODE>&quot;0&quot;</CODE> in breakpoints is now treated correctly.</P>
<P>The <A HREF="../../lib/Pod/perlguts.html#item_d"><CODE>d</CODE></A> command now checks the line number.</P>
<P><A HREF="../../lib/Pod/perlvar.html#item_%24%2E"><CODE>$.</CODE></A> is no longer corrupted by the debugger.</P>
<P>All debugger output now correctly goes to the socket if RemotePort
is set.</P>
<P></P>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_PERL5OPT">PERL5OPT</A></STRONG><BR>
<DD>
PERL5OPT can be set to more than one switch group.  Previously,
it used to be limited to one group of options only.
<P></P>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_chop"><CODE>chop()</CODE></A></STRONG><BR>
<DD>
<A HREF="#item_chop"><CODE>chop(@list)</CODE></A> in list context returned the characters chopped in reverse
order.  This has been reversed to be in the right order.
<P></P>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_Unicode_support">Unicode support</A></STRONG><BR>
<DD>
Unicode support has seen a large number of incremental improvements,
but continues to be highly experimental.  It is not expected to be
fully supported in the 5.6.x maintenance releases.
<P>substr(), join(), repeat(), reverse(), <A HREF="../../lib/Pod/perlfunc.html#item_quotemeta"><CODE>quotemeta()</CODE></A> and string
concatenation were all handling Unicode strings incorrectly in
Perl 5.6.0.  This has been corrected.</P>
<P>Support for <A HREF="../../lib/Pod/perlfunc.html#item_tr/"><CODE>tr///CU</CODE></A> and <A HREF="../../lib/Pod/perlfunc.html#item_tr/"><CODE>tr///UC</CODE></A> etc., have been removed since
we realized the interface is broken.  For similar functionality,
see <A HREF="../../lib/Pod/perlfunc.html#pack">pack in the perlfunc manpage</A>.</P>
<P>The Unicode Character Database has been updated to version 3.0.1
with additions made available to the public as of August 30, 2000.</P>
<P>The Unicode character classes \p{Blank} and \p{SpacePerl} have been
added.  ``Blank'' is like C isblank(), that is, it contains only
``horizontal whitespace'' (the space character is, the newline isn't),
and the ``SpacePerl'' is the Unicode equivalent of <CODE>\s</CODE> (\p{Space}
isn't, since that includes the vertical tabulator character, whereas
<CODE>\s</CODE> doesn't.)</P>
<P>If you are experimenting with Unicode support in perl, the development
versions of Perl may have more to offer.  In particular, I/O layers
are now available in the development track, but not in the maintenance
track, primarily to do backward compatibility issues.  Unicode support
is also evolving rapidly on a daily basis in the development track--the
maintenance track only reflects the most conservative of these changes.</P>
<P></P>
<LI><STRONG><A NAME="item_%2Dbit_support">-bit support</A></STRONG><BR>

Support for 64-bit platforms has been improved, but continues to be
experimental.  The level of support varies greatly among platforms.
<P></P>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_Compiler">Compiler</A></STRONG><BR>

<PRE>

=head1 Core Enhancements</PRE>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="interpreter cloning, threads, and concurrency">Interpreter cloning, threads, and concurrency</A></H2>
<P>Perl 5.6.0 introduces the beginnings of support for running multiple
interpreters concurrently in different threads.  In conjunction with
the <CODE>perl_clone()</CODE> API call, which can be used to selectively duplicate
the state of any given interpreter, it is possible to compile a
piece of code once in an interpreter, clone that interpreter
one or more times, and run all the resulting interpreters in distinct
threads.</P>
<P>On the Windows platform, this feature is used to emulate <A HREF="../../lib/Pod/perlfunc.html#item_fork"><CODE>fork()</CODE></A> at the
interpreter level.  See <A HREF="../../lib/Pod/perlfork.html">the perlfork manpage</A> for details about that.</P>
<P>This feature is still in evolution.  It is eventually meant to be used
to selectively clone a subroutine and data reachable from that
subroutine in a separate interpreter and run the cloned subroutine
in a separate thread.  Since there is no shared data between the
interpreters, little or no locking will be needed (unless parts of
the symbol table are explicitly shared).  This is obviously intended
to be an easy-to-use replacement for the existing threads support.</P>
<P>Support for cloning interpreters and interpreter concurrency can be
enabled using the -Dusethreads Configure option (see win32/Makefile for
how to enable it on Windows.)  The resulting perl executable will be
functionally identical to one that was built with -Dmultiplicity, but
the <CODE>perl_clone()</CODE> API call will only be available in the former.</P>
<P>-Dusethreads enables the cpp macro USE_ITHREADS by default, which in turn
enables Perl source code changes that provide a clear separation between
the op tree and the data it operates with.  The former is immutable, and
can therefore be shared between an interpreter and all of its clones,
while the latter is considered local to each interpreter, and is therefore
copied for each clone.</P>
<P>Note that building Perl with the -Dusemultiplicity Configure option
is adequate if you wish to run multiple <STRONG>independent</STRONG> interpreters
concurrently in different threads.  -Dusethreads only provides the
additional functionality of the <CODE>perl_clone()</CODE> API call and other
support for running <STRONG>cloned</STRONG> interpreters concurrently.</P>
<PRE>
    NOTE: This is an experimental feature.  Implementation details are
    subject to change.</PRE>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="lexically scoped warning categories">Lexically scoped warning categories</A></H2>
<P>You can now control the granularity of warnings emitted by perl at a finer
level using the <CODE>use warnings</CODE> pragma.  <A HREF="../../lib/warnings.html">the warnings manpage</A> and <A HREF="../../lib/Pod/perllexwarn.html">the perllexwarn manpage</A>
have copious documentation on this feature.</P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="unicode and utf8 support">Unicode and UTF-8 support</A></H2>
<P>Perl now uses UTF-8 as its internal representation for character
strings.  The <CODE>utf8</CODE> and <CODE>bytes</CODE> pragmas are used to control this support
in the current lexical scope.  See <A HREF="../../lib/Pod/perlunicode.html">the perlunicode manpage</A>, <A HREF="../../lib/utf8.html">the utf8 manpage</A> and <A HREF="../../lib/bytes.html">the bytes manpage</A> for
more information.</P>
<P>This feature is expected to evolve quickly to support some form of I/O
disciplines that can be used to specify the kind of input and output data
(bytes or characters).  Until that happens, additional modules from CPAN
will be needed to complete the toolkit for dealing with Unicode.</P>
<PRE>
    NOTE: This should be considered an experimental feature.  Implementation
    details are subject to change.</PRE>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="support for interpolating named characters">Support for interpolating named characters</A></H2>
<P>The new <CODE>\N</CODE> escape interpolates named characters within strings.
For example, <CODE>&quot;Hi! \N{WHITE SMILING FACE}&quot;</CODE> evaluates to a string
with a Unicode smiley face at the end.</P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="our declarations">``our'' declarations</A></H2>
<P>An ``our'' declaration introduces a value that can be best understood
as a lexically scoped symbolic alias to a global variable in the
package that was current where the variable was declared.  This is
mostly useful as an alternative to the <CODE>vars</CODE> pragma, but also provides
the opportunity to introduce typing and other attributes for such
variables.  See <A HREF="../../lib/Pod/perlfunc.html#our">our in the perlfunc manpage</A>.</P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="support for strings represented as a vector of ordinals">Support for strings represented as a vector of ordinals</A></H2>
<P>Literals of the form <CODE>v1.2.3.4</CODE> are now parsed as a string composed
of characters with the specified ordinals.  This is an alternative, more
readable way to construct (possibly Unicode) strings instead of
interpolating characters, as in <CODE>&quot;\x{1}\x{2}\x{3}\x{4}&quot;</CODE>.  The leading
<CODE>v</CODE> may be omitted if there are more than two ordinals, so <CODE>1.2.3</CODE> is
parsed the same as <CODE>v1.2.3</CODE>.</P>
<P>Strings written in this form are also useful to represent version ``numbers''.
It is easy to compare such version ``numbers'' (which are really just plain
strings) using any of the usual string comparison operators <CODE>eq</CODE>, <CODE>ne</CODE>,
<CODE>lt</CODE>, <CODE>gt</CODE>, etc., or perform bitwise string operations on them using <CODE>|</CODE>,
<CODE>&amp;</CODE>, etc.</P>
<P>In conjunction with the new <A HREF="../../lib/Pod/perlvar.html#item_%24%5EV"><CODE>$^V</CODE></A> magic variable (which contains
the perl version as a string), such literals can be used as a readable way
to check if you're running a particular version of Perl:</P>
<PRE>
    # this will parse in older versions of Perl also
    if ($^V and $^V gt v5.6.0) {
        # new features supported
    }</PRE>
<P><A HREF="../../lib/Pod/perlfunc.html#item_require"><CODE>require</CODE></A> and <A HREF="../../lib/Pod/perlfunc.html#item_use"><CODE>use</CODE></A> also have some special magic to support such literals.
They will be interpreted as a version rather than as a module name:</P>
<PRE>
    require v5.6.0;             # croak if $^V lt v5.6.0
    use v5.6.0;                 # same, but croaks at compile-time</PRE>
<P>Alternatively, the <CODE>v</CODE> may be omitted if there is more than one dot:</P>
<PRE>
    require 5.6.0;
    use 5.6.0;</PRE>
<P>Also, <A HREF="../../lib/Pod/perlfunc.html#item_sprintf"><CODE>sprintf</CODE></A> and <A HREF="../../lib/Pod/perlfunc.html#item_printf"><CODE>printf</CODE></A> support the Perl-specific format flag <CODE>%v</CODE>
to print ordinals of characters in arbitrary strings:</P>
<PRE>
    printf &quot;v%vd&quot;, $^V;         # prints current version, such as &quot;v5.5.650&quot;
    printf &quot;%*vX&quot;, &quot;:&quot;, $addr;  # formats IPv6 address
    printf &quot;%*vb&quot;, &quot; &quot;, $bits;  # displays bitstring</PRE>
<P>See <A HREF="../../lib/Pod/perldata.html#scalar value constructors">Scalar value constructors in the perldata manpage</A> for additional information.</P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="improved perl version numbering system">Improved Perl version numbering system</A></H2>
<P>Beginning with Perl version 5.6.0, the version number convention has been
changed to a ``dotted integer'' scheme that is more commonly found in open
source projects.</P>
<P>Maintenance versions of v5.6.0 will be released as v5.6.1, v5.6.2 etc.
The next development series following v5.6.0 will be numbered v5.7.x,
beginning with v5.7.0, and the next major production release following
v5.6.0 will be v5.8.0.</P>
<P>The English module now sets $PERL_VERSION to $^V (a string value) rather
than <A HREF="../../lib/Pod/perlvar.html#item_%24%5D"><CODE>$]</CODE></A> (a numeric value).  (This is a potential incompatibility.
Send us a report via perlbug if you are affected by this.)</P>
<P>The v1.2.3 syntax is also now legal in Perl.
See <A HREF="#support for strings represented as a vector of ordinals">Support for strings represented as a vector of ordinals</A> for more on that.</P>
<P>To cope with the new versioning system's use of at least three significant
digits for each version component, the method used for incrementing the
subversion number has also changed slightly.  We assume that versions older
than v5.6.0 have been incrementing the subversion component in multiples of
10.  Versions after v5.6.0 will increment them by 1.  Thus, using the new
notation, 5.005_03 is the ``same'' as v5.5.30, and the first maintenance
version following v5.6.0 will be v5.6.1 (which should be read as being
equivalent to a floating point value of 5.006_001 in the older format,
stored in <A HREF="../../lib/Pod/perlvar.html#item_%24%5D"><CODE>$]</CODE></A>).</P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="new syntax for declaring subroutine attributes">New syntax for declaring subroutine attributes</A></H2>
<P>Formerly, if you wanted to mark a subroutine as being a method call or
as requiring an automatic <A HREF="../../lib/Pod/perlfunc.html#item_lock"><CODE>lock()</CODE></A> when it is entered, you had to declare
that with a <CODE>use attrs</CODE> pragma in the body of the subroutine.
That can now be accomplished with declaration syntax, like this:</P>
<PRE>
    sub mymethod : locked method ;
    ...
    sub mymethod : locked method {
        ...
    }</PRE>
<PRE>
    sub othermethod :locked :method ;
    ...
    sub othermethod :locked :method {
        ...
    }</PRE>
<P>(Note how only the first <CODE>:</CODE> is mandatory, and whitespace surrounding
the <CODE>:</CODE> is optional.)</P>
<P><EM>AutoSplit.pm</EM> and <EM>SelfLoader.pm</EM> have been updated to keep the attributes
with the stubs they provide.  See <A HREF="../../lib/attributes.html">the attributes manpage</A>.</P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="file and directory handles can be autovivified">File and directory handles can be autovivified</A></H2>
<P>Similar to how constructs such as <CODE>$x-&gt;[0]</CODE> autovivify a reference,
handle constructors (open(), opendir(), pipe(), socketpair(), sysopen(),
socket(), and <A HREF="../../lib/Pod/perlfunc.html#item_accept"><CODE>accept())</CODE></A> now autovivify a file or directory handle
if the handle passed to them is an uninitialized scalar variable.  This
allows the constructs such as <A HREF="#item_open"><CODE>open(my $fh, ...)</CODE></A> and <A HREF="#item_open"><CODE>open(local $fh,...)</CODE></A>
to be used to create filehandles that will conveniently be closed
automatically when the scope ends, provided there are no other references
to them.  This largely eliminates the need for typeglobs when opening
filehandles that must be passed around, as in the following example:</P>
<PRE>
    sub myopen {
        open my $fh, &quot;@_&quot;
             or die &quot;Can't open '@_': $!&quot;;
        return $fh;
    }</PRE>

<P>Note that unless you have the case (a) you will have to configure
and compile Perl using the -Duse64bitint Configure flag.</P>
<PRE>
    NOTE: The Configure flags -Duselonglong and -Duse64bits have been
    deprecated.  Use -Duse64bitint instead.</PRE>
<P>There are actually two modes of 64-bitness: the first one is achieved
using Configure -Duse64bitint and the second one using Configure
-Duse64bitall.  The difference is that the first one is minimal and
the second one maximal.  The first works in more places than the second.</P>
<P>The <CODE>use64bitint</CODE> does only as much as is required to get 64-bit
integers into Perl (this may mean, for example, using ``long longs'')
while your memory may still be limited to 2 gigabytes (because your
pointers could still be 32-bit).  Note that the name <CODE>64bitint</CODE> does
not imply that your C compiler will be using 64-bit <A HREF="../../lib/Pod/perlfunc.html#item_int"><CODE>int</CODE></A>s (it might,
but it doesn't have to): the <CODE>use64bitint</CODE> means that you will be
able to have 64 bits wide scalar values.</P>
<P>The <CODE>use64bitall</CODE> goes all the way by attempting to switch also
integers (if it can), longs (and pointers) to being 64-bit.  This may
create an even more binary incompatible Perl than -Duse64bitint: the
resulting executable may not run at all in a 32-bit box, or you may
have to reboot/reconfigure/rebuild your operating system to be 64-bit
aware.</P>
<P>Natively 64-bit systems like Alpha and Cray need neither -Duse64bitint
nor -Duse64bitall.</P>
<P>Last but not least: note that due to Perl's habit of always using
floating point numbers, the quads are still not true integers.
When quads overflow their limits (0...18_446_744_073_709_551_615 unsigned,
-9_223_372_036_854_775_808...9_223_372_036_854_775_807 signed), they
are silently promoted to floating point numbers, after which they will
start losing precision (in their lower digits).</P>
<PRE>
    NOTE: 64-bit support is still experimental on most platforms.
    Existing support only covers the LP64 data model.  In particular, the
    LLP64 data model is not yet supported.  64-bit libraries and system
    APIs on many platforms have not stabilized--your mileage may vary.</PRE>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="large file support">Large file support</A></H2>
<P>If you have filesystems that support ``large files'' (files larger than
2 gigabytes), you may now also be able to create and access them from
Perl.</P>
<PRE>
    NOTE: The default action is to enable large file support, if
    available on the platform.</PRE>
<P>If the large file support is on, and you have a Fcntl constant
O_LARGEFILE, the O_LARGEFILE is automatically added to the flags
of sysopen().</P>
<P>Beware that unless your filesystem also supports ``sparse files'' seeking
to umpteen petabytes may be inadvisable.</P>
<P>Note that in addition to requiring a proper file system to do large
files you may also need to adjust your per-process (or your
per-system, or per-process-group, or per-user-group) maximum filesize
limits before running Perl scripts that try to handle large files,
especially if you intend to write such files.</P>
<P>Finally, in addition to your process/process group maximum filesize
limits, you may have quota limits on your filesystems that stop you
(your user id or your user group id) from using large files.</P>
<P>Adjusting your process/user/group/file system/operating system limits
is outside the scope of Perl core language.  For process limits, you
may try increasing the limits using your shell's limits/limit/ulimit
command before running Perl.  The BSD::Resource extension (not
included with the standard Perl distribution) may also be of use, it
offers the getrlimit/setrlimit interface that can be used to adjust
process resource usage limits, including the maximum filesize limit.</P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="long doubles">Long doubles</A></H2>
<P>In some systems you may be able to use long doubles to enhance the

this support (if it is available).</P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="more bits">``more bits''</A></H2>

<P>Perl subroutines with a prototype of <CODE>($$)</CODE>, and XSUBs in general, can
now be used as sort subroutines.  In either case, the two elements to
be compared are passed as normal parameters in @_.  See <A HREF="../../lib/Pod/perlfunc.html#sort">sort in the perlfunc manpage</A>.</P>
<P>For unprototyped sort subroutines, the historical behavior of passing 
the elements to be compared as the global variables $a and $b remains
unchanged.</P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="sort $coderef @foo allowed"><CODE>sort $coderef @foo</CODE> allowed</A></H2>

subroutines named <CODE>CHECK</CODE> are now special.  These are queued up during

<A HREF="../../lib/Pod/perlfunc.html#item_rand"><CODE>rand(3)</CODE></A> function.  As of 5.005_52, Configure tests for drand48(),
random(), and <A HREF="../../lib/Pod/perlfunc.html#item_rand"><CODE>rand()</CODE></A> (in that order) and picks the first one it finds.</P>
<P>These changes should result in better random numbers from rand().</P>

<H2><A NAME="improved qw// operator">Improved <A HREF="../../lib/Pod/perlfunc.html#item_qw/"><CODE>qw//</CODE></A> operator</A></H2>

instead of being replaced with a run time call to <A HREF="../../lib/Pod/perlfunc.html#item_split"><CODE>split()</CODE></A>.  This
removes the confusing misbehaviour of <A HREF="../../lib/Pod/perlfunc.html#item_qw/"><CODE>qw//</CODE></A> in scalar context, which
had inherited that behaviour from split().</P>
<P>Thus:</P>
<PRE>

<P>
<H2><A NAME="comments in pack() templates">Comments in <A HREF="../../lib/Pod/perlfunc.html#item_pack"><CODE>pack()</CODE></A> templates</A></H2>
<P>The '#' character in a template introduces a comment up to

templates.</P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="weak references">Weak references</A></H2>
<P>In previous versions of Perl, you couldn't cache objects so as
to allow them to be deleted if the last reference from outside 
the cache is deleted.  The reference in the cache would hold a
reference count on the object and the objects would never be
destroyed.</P>
<P>Another familiar problem is with circular references.  When an
object references itself, its reference count would never go
down to zero, and it would not get destroyed until the program
is about to exit.</P>
<P>Weak references solve this by allowing you to ``weaken'' any
reference, that is, make it not count towards the reference count.
When the last non-weak reference to an object is deleted, the object
is destroyed and all the weak references to the object are
automatically undef-ed.</P>
<P>To use this feature, you need the WeakRef package from CPAN, which
contains additional documentation.</P>

<P>
<H2><A NAME="some arrows may be omitted in calls through references">Some arrows may be omitted in calls through references</A></H2>
<P>Perl now allows the arrow to be omitted in many constructs
involving subroutine calls through references.  For example,
<CODE>$foo[10]-&gt;('foo')</CODE> may now be written <CODE>$foo[10]('foo')</CODE>.
This is rather similar to how the arrow may be omitted from
<CODE>$foo[10]-&gt;{'foo'}</CODE>.  Note however, that the arrow is still
required for <CODE>foo(10)-&gt;('bar')</CODE>.</P>

<H2><A NAME="exists() is supported on subroutine names"><A HREF="../../lib/Pod/perlfunc.html#item_exists"><CODE>exists()</CODE></A> is supported on subroutine names</A></H2>
<P>The <A HREF="../../lib/Pod/perlfunc.html#item_exists"><CODE>exists()</CODE></A> builtin now works on subroutine names.  A subroutine
is considered to exist if it has been declared (even if implicitly).

<H2><A NAME="exists() and delete() are supported on array elements"><A HREF="../../lib/Pod/perlfunc.html#item_exists"><CODE>exists()</CODE></A> and <A HREF="#item_delete"><CODE>delete()</CODE></A> are supported on array elements</A></H2>
<P>The <A HREF="../../lib/Pod/perlfunc.html#item_exists"><CODE>exists()</CODE></A> and <A HREF="#item_delete"><CODE>delete()</CODE></A> builtins now work on simple arrays as well.
The behavior is similar to that on hash elements.</P>
<P><A HREF="../../lib/Pod/perlfunc.html#item_exists"><CODE>exists()</CODE></A> can be used to check whether an array element has been
initialized.  This avoids autovivifying array elements that don't exist.
If the array is tied, the <CODE>EXISTS()</CODE> method in the corresponding tied
package will be invoked.</P>
<P><A HREF="#item_delete"><CODE>delete()</CODE></A> may be used to remove an element from the array and return
it.  The array element at that position returns to its uninitialized
state, so that testing for the same element with <A HREF="../../lib/Pod/perlfunc.html#item_exists"><CODE>exists()</CODE></A> will return
false.  If the element happens to be the one at the end, the size of
the array also shrinks up to the highest element that tests true for
exists(), or 0 if none such is found.  If the array is tied, the <CODE>DELETE()</CODE> 
method in the corresponding tied package will be invoked.</P>
<P>See <A HREF="../../lib/Pod/perlfunc.html#exists">exists in the perlfunc manpage</A> and <A HREF="../../lib/Pod/perlfunc.html#delete">delete in the perlfunc manpage</A> for examples.</P>

<H2><A NAME="pseudohashes work better">Pseudo-hashes work better</A></H2>
<P>Dereferencing some types of reference values in a pseudo-hash,
such as <CODE>$ph-&gt;{foo}[1]</CODE>, was accidentally disallowed.  This has
been corrected.</P>
<P>When applied to a pseudo-hash element, <A HREF="../../lib/Pod/perlfunc.html#item_exists"><CODE>exists()</CODE></A> now reports whether
the specified value exists, not merely if the key is valid.</P>
<P><A HREF="#item_delete"><CODE>delete()</CODE></A> now works on pseudo-hashes.  When given a pseudo-hash element
or slice it deletes the values corresponding to the keys (but not the keys
themselves).  See <A HREF="../../lib/Pod/perlref.html#pseudohashes: using an array as a hash">Pseudo-hashes: Using an array as a hash in the perlref manpage</A>.</P>
<P>Pseudo-hash slices with constant keys are now optimized to array lookups
at compile-time.</P>
<P>List assignments to pseudo-hash slices are now supported.</P>
<P>The <CODE>fields</CODE> pragma now provides ways to create pseudo-hashes, via
fields::new() and fields::phash().  See <A HREF="../../lib/fields.html">the fields manpage</A>.</P>
<PRE>
    NOTE: The pseudo-hash data type continues to be experimental.

<H2><A NAME="automatic flushing of output buffers">Automatic flushing of output buffers</A></H2>
<P>fork(), exec(), system(), qx//, and pipe open()s now flush buffers
of all files opened for output when the operation was attempted.  This

<H2><A NAME="$^x variables may now have names longer than one character">$^X variables may now have names longer than one character</A></H2>
<P>Formerly, $^X was synonymous with ${``\cX''}, but $^XY was a syntax
error.  Now variable names that begin with a control character may be
arbitrarily long.  However, for compatibility reasons, these variables
<EM>must</EM> be written with explicit braces, as <CODE>${^XY}</CODE> for example.
<CODE>${^XYZ}</CODE> is synonymous with ${``\cXYZ''}.  Variable names with more
than one control character, such as <CODE>${^XY^Z}</CODE>, are illegal.</P>
<P>The old syntax has not changed.  As before, `^X' may be either a
literal control-X character or the two-character sequence `caret' plus
`X'.  When braces are omitted, the variable name stops after the
control character.  Thus <CODE>&quot;$^XYZ&quot;</CODE> continues to be synonymous with
<CODE>$^X . &quot;YZ&quot;</CODE> as before.</P>
<P>As before, lexical variables may not have names beginning with control
characters.  As before, variables whose names begin with a control
character are always forced to be in package `main'.  All such variables
are reserved for future extensions, except those that begin with
<CODE>^_</CODE>, which may be used by user programs and are guaranteed not to
acquire special meaning in any future version of Perl.</P>

<H2><A NAME="arrays now always interpolate into doublequoted strings">Arrays now always interpolate into double-quoted strings</A></H2>
<P>In double-quoted strings, arrays now interpolate, no matter what.  The
behavior in earlier versions of perl 5 was that arrays would interpolate
into strings if the array had been mentioned before the string was
compiled, and otherwise Perl would raise a fatal compile-time error.
In versions 5.000 through 5.003, the error was</P>

        Literal @example now requires backslash</PRE>
<P>In versions 5.004_01 through 5.6.0, the error was</P>
<PRE>
        In string, @example now must be written as \@example</PRE>
<P>The idea here was to get people into the habit of writing
<CODE>&quot;fred\@example.com&quot;</CODE> when they wanted a literal <CODE>@</CODE> sign, just as
they have always written <CODE>&quot;Give me back my \$5&quot;</CODE> when they wanted a
literal <CODE>$</CODE> sign.</P>
<P>Starting with 5.6.1, when Perl now sees an <CODE>@</CODE> sign in a
double-quoted string, it <EM>always</EM> attempts to interpolate an array,
regardless of whether or not the array has been used or declared
already.  The fatal error has been downgraded to an optional warning:</P>
<PRE>
        Possible unintended interpolation of @example in string</PRE>
<P>This warns you that <CODE>&quot;fred@example.com&quot;</CODE> is going to turn into
<CODE>fred.com</CODE> if you don't backslash the <CODE>@</CODE>.

The Perl Compiler suite has been extensively reworked for this

Overall, Benchmark results exhibit lower average error and better timing
accuracy.
<P>You can now run tests for <EM>n</EM> seconds instead of guessing the right
number of tests to run: e.g., timethese(-5, ...) will run each 
code for at least 5 CPU seconds.  Zero as the ``number of repetitions''
means ``for at least 3 CPU seconds''.  The output format has also
changed.  For example:</P>
<PRE>
   use Benchmark;$x=3;timethese(-5,{a=&gt;sub{$x*$x},b=&gt;sub{$x**2}})</PRE>
<P>will now output something like this:</P>
<PRE>
   Benchmark: running a, b, each for at least 5 CPU seconds...

<P>New features: ``each for at least N CPU seconds...'', ``wallclock secs'',

<P>A new function <CODE>countit()</CODE> is just like <CODE>timeit()</CODE> except that it takes a
TIME instead of a COUNT.</P>
<P>A new function <CODE>cmpthese()</CODE> prints a chart comparing the results of each test

identifying pod paragraphs and commands in the input and hands off the
parsed paragraphs and commands to user-defined methods which are free

<P>As of release 5.6.0 of Perl, Pod::Parser is now the officially sanctioned
``base parser code'' recommended for use by all pod2xxx translators.
Pod::Text (pod2text) and Pod::Man (pod2man) have already been converted

<DD>
Pod::Text has been rewritten to use Pod::Parser.  While <CODE>pod2text()</CODE> is
still available for backwards compatibility, the module now has a new
preferred interface.  See <A HREF="../../lib/Pod/Text.html">the Pod::Text manpage</A> for the details.  The new Pod::Text
module is easily subclassed for tweaks to the output, and two such
subclasses (Pod::Text::Termcap for man-page-style bold and underlining
using termcap information, and Pod::Text::Color for markup with ANSI color
sequences) are now standard.
<P>pod2man has been turned into a module, Pod::Man, which also uses
Pod::Parser.  In the process, several outstanding bugs related to quotes
in section headers, quoting of code escapes, and nested lists have been
fixed.  pod2man is now a wrapper script around this module.</P>
<P></P>
<DT><STRONG>SDBM_File</STRONG><BR>
<DD>
An EXISTS method has been added to this module (and <CODE>sdbm_exists()</CODE> has
been added to the underlying sdbm library), so one can now call exists
on an SDBM_File tied hash and get the correct result, rather than a
runtime error.
<P>A bug that may have caused data loss when more than one disk block
happens to be read from the database in a single <CODE>FETCH()</CODE> has been
fixed.</P>

A new feature called ``DBM Filters'' has been added to all the

DBM Filters add four new methods to each DBM module:
<PRE>
    filter_store_key

<P>The -Dusethreads flag now enables the experimental interpreter-based thread
support by default.  To get the flavor of experimental threads that was in
5.005 instead, you need to run Configure with ``-Dusethreads -Duse5005threads''.</P>
<P>As of v5.6.0, interpreter-threads support is still lacking a way to
create new threads from Perl (i.e., <CODE>use Thread;</CODE> will not work with

<P>The Configure options enabling the use of threads and the use of
64-bitness are now more daring in the sense that they no more have an
explicit list of operating systems of known threads/64-bit
capabilities.  In other words: if your operating system has the
necessary APIs and datatypes, you should be able just to go ahead and
use them, for threads by Configure -Dusethreads, and for 64 bits
either explicitly by Configure -Duse64bitint or implicitly if your
system has 64-bit wide datatypes.  See also <A HREF="#64bit support">64-bit support</A>.</P>

of locally-added modules, scripts, and manpages.  See the section on
Installation Directories in the INSTALL file for complete details.
For most users building and installing from source, the defaults should
be fine.</P>
<P>If you previously used <CODE>Configure -Dsitelib</CODE> or <CODE>-Dsitearch</CODE> to set
special values for library directories, you might wish to consider using
the new <CODE>-Dsiteprefix</CODE> setting instead.  Also, if you wish to re-use a
config.sh file from an earlier version of perl, you should be sure to
check that Configure makes sensible choices for the new directories.

<P>The <CODE>Shell</CODE> module is supported.</P>
<P>Better support for building Perl under command.com in Windows 95

<P>Scripts are read in binary mode by default to allow ByteLoader (and
the filter mechanism in general) to work properly.  For compatibility,
the DATA filehandle will be set to text mode if a carriage return is
detected at the end of the line containing the __END__ or __DATA__
token; if not, the DATA filehandle will be left open in binary mode.

of the <A HREF="#item_glob"><CODE>glob()</CODE></A> operator, but there may be compatibility issues for

<P>The use of <A HREF="../../lib/Pod/perlfunc.html#item_return"><CODE>return</CODE></A> within <A HREF="../../lib/Pod/perlfunc.html#item_eval"><CODE>eval {...}</CODE></A> caused $@ not to be reset

<H2><A NAME="all compilation errors are true errors">All compilation errors are true errors</A></H2>
<P>Some ``errors'' encountered at compile time were by necessity 
generated as warnings followed by eventual termination of the
program.  This enabled more such errors to be reported in a
single run, rather than causing a hard stop at the first error
that was encountered.</P>
<P>The mechanism for reporting such errors has been reimplemented
to queue compile-time errors and report them at the end of the
compilation as true errors rather than as warnings.  This fixes
cases where error messages leaked through in the form of warnings
when code was compiled at run time using <A HREF="../../lib/Pod/perlfunc.html#item_eval"><CODE>eval STRING</CODE></A>, and
also allows such errors to be reliably trapped using <CODE>eval &quot;...&quot;</CODE>.</P>

<H2><A NAME="behavior of list slices is more consistent">Behavior of list slices is more consistent</A></H2>
<P>When taking a slice of a literal list (as opposed to a slice of
an array or hash), Perl used to return an empty list if the
result happened to be composed of all undef values.</P>
<P>The new behavior is to produce an empty list if (and only if)
the original list was empty.  Consider the following example:</P>
<PRE>
    @a = (1,undef,undef,2)[2,1,2];</PRE>
<P>The old behavior would have resulted in @a having no elements.
The new behavior ensures it has three undefined elements.</P>
<P>Note in particular that the behavior of slices of the following
cases remains unchanged:</P>
<PRE>
    @a = ()[1,2];
    @a = (getpwent)[7,0];
    @a = (anything_returning_empty_list())[2,1,2];

If your platform is either natively 64-bit or if Perl has been
configured to used 64-bit integers, i.e., $Config{ivsize} is 8, 
there may be a potential incompatibility in the behavior of bitwise
numeric operators (&amp; | ^ ~ &lt;&lt; &gt;&gt;).  These operators used to strictly
operate on the lower 32 bits of integers in previous versions, but now
operate over the entire native integral width.  In particular, note
that unary <CODE>~</CODE> will produce different results on platforms that have
different $Config{ivsize}.  For portability, be sure to mask off
the excess bits in the result of unary <CODE>~</CODE>, e.g., <CODE>~$x &amp; 0xffffffff</CODE>.

Release 5.005 grandfathered old global symbol names by providing preprocessor

This new build option provides a set of macros for all API functions
such that an implicit interpreter/thread context argument is passed to
every API function.  As a result of this, something like <CODE>sv_setsv(foo,bar)</CODE>
amounts to a macro invocation that actually translates to something like
<CODE>Perl_sv_setsv(my_perl,foo,bar)</CODE>.  While this is generally expected
to not have any significant source compatibility issues, the difference
between a macro and a real function call will need to be considered.
<P>This means that there <STRONG>is</STRONG> a source compatibility issue as a result of
this if your extensions attempt to use pointers to any of the Perl API
functions.</P>

<DD>
Enabling Perl's malloc in release 5.005 and earlier caused the namespace of
the system's malloc family of functions to be usurped by the Perl versions,
since by default they used the same names.  Besides causing problems on
platforms that do not allow these functions to be cleanly replaced, this
also meant that the system versions could not be called in programs that
used Perl's malloc.  Previous versions of Perl have allowed this behaviour
to be suppressed with the HIDEMYMALLOC and EMBEDMYMALLOC preprocessor
definitions.
<P>As of release 5.6.0, Perl's malloc family of functions have default names
distinct from the system versions.  You need to explicitly compile perl with
<CODE>-DPERL_POLLUTE_MALLOC</CODE> to get the older behaviour.  HIDEMYMALLOC
and EMBEDMYMALLOC have no effect, since the behaviour they enabled is now
the default.</P>
<P>Note that these functions do <STRONG>not</STRONG> constitute Perl's memory allocation API.

<P>However, the developers of Perl 5.004 could not fix this bug completely,
because at least two widely-used modules depend on the old meaning of
``$$0'' in a string.  So Perl 5.004 still interprets ``$$&lt;digit&gt;'' in the
old (broken) way inside strings; but it generates this message as a
warning.  And in Perl 5.005, this special treatment will cease.</P>
