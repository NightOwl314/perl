<P>
<H1><A NAME="name">NAME</A></H1>
<P>perldelta - what's new for perl5.004</P>
<P>
<HR>
<H1><A NAME="description">DESCRIPTION</A></H1>
<P>This document describes differences between the 5.003 release (as
documented in <EM>Programming Perl</EM>, second edition--the Camel Book) and
this one.</P>
<P>
<HR>
<H1><A NAME="supported environments">Supported Environments</A></H1>
<P>Perl5.004 builds out of the box on Unix, Plan 9, LynxOS, VMS, OS/2,
QNX, AmigaOS, and Windows NT.  Perl runs on Windows 95 as well, but it
cannot be built there, for lack of a reasonable command interpreter.</P>
<P>
<HR>
<H1><A NAME="core changes">Core Changes</A></H1>
<P>Most importantly, many bugs were fixed, including several security
problems.  See the <EM>Changes</EM> file in the distribution for details.</P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="list assignment to %env works">List assignment to %ENV works</A></H2>
<P><A HREF="../../lib/Pod/perlvar.html#item_%ENV"><CODE>%ENV = ()</CODE></A> and <A HREF="../../lib/Pod/perlvar.html#item_%ENV"><CODE>%ENV = @list</CODE></A> now work as expected (except on VMS
where it generates a fatal error).</P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="change to can't locate foo.pm in @inc error">Change to ``Can't locate Foo.pm in @INC'' error</A></H2>
<P>The error ``Can't locate Foo.pm in @INC'' now lists the contents of @INC
for easier debugging.</P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="compilation option: binary compatibility with 5.003">Compilation option: Binary compatibility with 5.003</A></H2>
<P>There is a new Configure question that asks if you want to maintain
binary compatibility with Perl 5.003.  If you choose binary
compatibility, you do not have to recompile your extensions, but you
might have symbol conflicts if you embed Perl in another application,
just as in the 5.003 release.  By default, binary compatibility
is preserved at the expense of symbol table pollution.</P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="$perl5opt environment variable">$PERL5OPT environment variable</A></H2>
<P>You may now put Perl options in the $PERL5OPT environment variable.
Unless Perl is running with taint checks, it will interpret this
variable as if its contents had appeared on a ``#!perl'' line at the
beginning of your script, except that hyphens are optional.  PERL5OPT
may only be used to set the following switches: <STRONG>-[DIMUdmw]</STRONG>.</P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="limitations on m, m, and t options">Limitations on <STRONG>-M</STRONG>, <STRONG>-m</STRONG>, and <STRONG>-T</STRONG> options</A></H2>
<P>The <CODE>-M</CODE> and <CODE>-m</CODE> options are no longer allowed on the <CODE>#!</CODE> line of
a script.  If a script needs a module, it should invoke it with the
<A HREF="#item_use"><CODE>use</CODE></A> pragma.</P>
<P>The <STRONG>-T</STRONG> option is also forbidden on the <CODE>#!</CODE> line of a script,
unless it was present on the Perl command line.  Due to the way <CODE>#!</CODE>
works, this usually means that <STRONG>-T</STRONG> must be in the first argument.
Thus:</P>
<PRE>
    #!/usr/bin/perl -T -w</PRE>
<P>will probably work for an executable script invoked as <CODE>scriptname</CODE>,
while:</P>
<PRE>
    #!/usr/bin/perl -w -T</PRE>
<P>will probably fail under the same conditions.  (Non-Unix systems will
probably not follow this rule.)  But <CODE>perl scriptname</CODE> is guaranteed
to fail, since then there is no chance of <STRONG>-T</STRONG> being found on the
command line before it is found on the <CODE>#!</CODE> line.</P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="more precise warnings">More precise warnings</A></H2>
<P>If you removed the <STRONG>-w</STRONG> option from your Perl 5.003 scripts because it
made Perl too verbose, we recommend that you try putting it back when
you upgrade to Perl 5.004.  Each new perl version tends to remove some
undesirable warnings, while adding new warnings that may catch bugs in
your scripts.</P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="deprecated: inherited autoload for nonmethods">Deprecated: Inherited <CODE>AUTOLOAD</CODE> for non-methods</A></H2>
<P>Before Perl 5.004, <CODE>AUTOLOAD</CODE> functions were looked up as methods
(using the <CODE>@ISA</CODE> hierarchy), even when the function to be autoloaded
was called as a plain function (e.g. <CODE>Foo::bar()</CODE>), not a method
(e.g. <CODE>Foo-&gt;bar()</CODE> or <CODE>$obj-&gt;bar()</CODE>).</P>
<P>Perl 5.005 will use method lookup only for methods' <CODE>AUTOLOAD</CODE>s.
However, there is a significant base of existing code that may be using
the old behavior.  So, as an interim step, Perl 5.004 issues an optional
warning when a non-method uses an inherited <CODE>AUTOLOAD</CODE>.</P>
<P>The simple rule is:  Inheritance will not work when autoloading
non-methods.  The simple fix for old code is:  In any module that used to
depend on inheriting <CODE>AUTOLOAD</CODE> for non-methods from a base class named
<CODE>BaseClass</CODE>, execute <CODE>*AUTOLOAD = \&amp;BaseClass::AUTOLOAD</CODE> during startup.</P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="previously deprecated %overload is no longer usable">Previously deprecated %OVERLOAD is no longer usable</A></H2>
<P>Using %OVERLOAD to define overloading was deprecated in 5.003.
Overloading is now defined using the overload pragma. %OVERLOAD is
still used internally but should not be used by Perl scripts. See
<A HREF="../../lib/overload.html">the overload manpage</A> for more details.</P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="subroutine arguments created only when they're modified">Subroutine arguments created only when they're modified</A></H2>
<P>In Perl 5.004, nonexistent array and hash elements used as subroutine
parameters are brought into existence only if they are actually
assigned to (via <A HREF="../../lib/Pod/perlvar.html#item_%40_"><CODE>@_</CODE></A>).</P>
<P>Earlier versions of Perl vary in their handling of such arguments.
Perl versions 5.002 and 5.003 always brought them into existence.
Perl versions 5.000 and 5.001 brought them into existence only if
they were not the first argument (which was almost certainly a bug).
Earlier versions of Perl never brought them into existence.</P>
<P>For example, given this code:</P>
<PRE>
     undef @a; undef %a;
     sub show { print $_[0] };
     sub change { $_[0]++ };
     show($a[2]);
     change($a{b});</PRE>
<P>After this code executes in Perl 5.004, $a{b} exists but $a[2] does
not.  In Perl 5.002 and 5.003, both $a{b} and $a[2] would have existed
(but $a[2]'s value would have been undefined).</P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="group vector changeable with $)">Group vector changeable with <A HREF="../../lib/Pod/perlvar.html#item_%24%29"><CODE>$)</CODE></A></A></H2>
<P>The <A HREF="../../lib/Pod/perlvar.html#item_%24%29"><CODE>$)</CODE></A> special variable has always (well, in Perl 5, at least)
reflected not only the current effective group, but also the group list
as returned by the <CODE>getgroups()</CODE> C function (if there is one).
However, until this release, there has not been a way to call the
<CODE>setgroups()</CODE> C function from Perl.</P>
<P>In Perl 5.004, assigning to <A HREF="../../lib/Pod/perlvar.html#item_%24%29"><CODE>$)</CODE></A> is exactly symmetrical with examining
it: The first number in its string value is used as the effective gid;
if there are any numbers after the first one, they are passed to the
<CODE>setgroups()</CODE> C function (if there is one).</P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="fixed parsing of $$<digit>, &$<digit>, etc.">Fixed parsing of $$&lt;digit&gt;, &amp;$&lt;digit&gt;, etc.</A></H2>
<P>Perl versions before 5.004 misinterpreted any type marker followed by
``$'' and a digit.  For example, ``$$0'' was incorrectly taken to mean
``${$}0'' instead of ``${$0}''.  This bug is (mostly) fixed in Perl 5.004.</P>
<P>However, the developers of Perl 5.004 could not fix this bug completely,
because at least two widely-used modules depend on the old meaning of
``$$0'' in a string.  So Perl 5.004 still interprets ``$$&lt;digit&gt;'' in the
old (broken) way inside strings; but it generates this message as a
warning.  And in Perl 5.005, this special treatment will cease.</P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="fixed localization of $<digit>, $&, etc.">Fixed localization of $&lt;digit&gt;, $&amp;, etc.</A></H2>
<P>Perl versions before 5.004 did not always properly localize the
regex-related special variables.  Perl 5.004 does localize them, as
the documentation has always said it should.  This may result in $1,
$2, etc. no longer being set where existing programs use them.</P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="no resetting of $. on implicit close">No resetting of $. on implicit close</A></H2>
<P>The documentation for Perl 5.0 has always stated that <A HREF="../../lib/Pod/perlvar.html#item_%24%2E"><CODE>$.</CODE></A> is <EM>not</EM>
reset when an already-open file handle is reopened with no intervening
call to <A HREF="../../lib/Pod/perlfunc.html#item_close"><CODE>close</CODE></A>.  Due to a bug, perl versions 5.000 through 5.003
<EM>did</EM> reset <A HREF="../../lib/Pod/perlvar.html#item_%24%2E"><CODE>$.</CODE></A> under that circumstance; Perl 5.004 does not.</P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="wantarray may return undef"><A HREF="../../lib/Pod/perlfunc.html#item_wantarray"><CODE>wantarray</CODE></A> may return undef</A></H2>
<P>The <A HREF="../../lib/Pod/perlfunc.html#item_wantarray"><CODE>wantarray</CODE></A> operator returns true if a subroutine is expected to
return a list, and false otherwise.  In Perl 5.004, <A HREF="../../lib/Pod/perlfunc.html#item_wantarray"><CODE>wantarray</CODE></A> can
also return the undefined value if a subroutine's return value will
not be used at all, which allows subroutines to avoid a time-consuming
calculation of a return value if it isn't going to be used.</P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="eval expr determines value of expr in scalar context"><A HREF="../../lib/Pod/perlfunc.html#item_eval"><CODE>eval EXPR</CODE></A> determines value of EXPR in scalar context</A></H2>
<P>Perl (version 5) used to determine the value of EXPR inconsistently,
sometimes incorrectly using the surrounding context for the determination.
Now, the value of EXPR (before being parsed by eval) is always determined in
a scalar context.  Once parsed, it is executed as before, by providing
the context that the scope surrounding the eval provided.  This change
makes the behavior Perl4 compatible, besides fixing bugs resulting from
the inconsistent behavior.  This program:</P>
<PRE>
    @a = qw(time now is time);
    print eval @a;
    print '|', scalar eval @a;</PRE>
<P>used to print something like ``timenowis881399109|4'', but now (and in perl4)
prints ``4|4''.</P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="changes to tainting checks">Changes to tainting checks</A></H2>
<P>A bug in previous versions may have failed to detect some insecure
conditions when taint checks are turned on.  (Taint checks are used
in setuid or setgid scripts, or when explicitly turned on with the
<A HREF="../../lib/Pod/perlrun.html#item_%2DT"><CODE>-T</CODE></A> invocation option.)  Although it's unlikely, this may cause a
previously-working script to now fail -- which should be construed
as a blessing, since that indicates a potentially-serious security
hole was just plugged.</P>
<P>The new restrictions when tainting include:</P>
<DL>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_glob">No <CODE>glob()</CODE> or &lt;*&gt;</A></STRONG><BR>
<DD>
These operators may spawn the C shell (csh), which cannot be made
safe.  This restriction will be lifted in a future version of Perl
when globbing is implemented without the use of an external program.
<P></P>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_No_spawning_if_tainted_%24CDPATH%2C_%24ENV%2C_%24B">No spawning if tainted $CDPATH, $ENV, $BASH_ENV</A></STRONG><BR>
<DD>
These environment variables may alter the behavior of spawned programs
(especially shells) in ways that subvert security.  So now they are
treated as dangerous, in the manner of $IFS and $PATH.
<P></P>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_No_spawning_if_tainted_%24TERM_doesn%27t_look_like">No spawning if tainted $TERM doesn't look like a terminal name</A></STRONG><BR>
<DD>
Some termcap libraries do unsafe things with $TERM.  However, it would be
unnecessarily harsh to treat all $TERM values as unsafe, since only shell
metacharacters can cause trouble in $TERM.  So a tainted $TERM is
considered to be safe if it contains only alphanumerics, underscores,
dashes, and colons, and unsafe if it contains other characters (including
whitespace).
<P></P></DL>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="new opcode module and revised safe module">New Opcode module and revised Safe module</A></H2>
<P>A new Opcode module supports the creation, manipulation and
application of opcode masks.  The revised Safe module has a new API
and is implemented using the new Opcode module.  Please read the new
Opcode and Safe documentation.</P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="embedding improvements">Embedding improvements</A></H2>
<P>In older versions of Perl it was not possible to create more than one
Perl interpreter instance inside a single process without leaking like a
sieve and/or crashing.  The bugs that caused this behavior have all been
fixed.  However, you still must take care when embedding Perl in a C
program.  See the updated perlembed manpage for tips on how to manage
your interpreters.</P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="internal change: filehandle class based on io::* classes">Internal change: FileHandle class based on IO::* classes</A></H2>
<P>File handles are now stored internally as type IO::Handle.  The
FileHandle module is still supported for backwards compatibility, but
it is now merely a front end to the IO::* modules -- specifically,
IO::Handle, IO::Seekable, and IO::File.  We suggest, but do not
require, that you use the IO::* modules in new code.</P>
<P>In harmony with this change, <CODE>*GLOB{FILEHANDLE}</CODE> is now just a
backward-compatible synonym for <CODE>*GLOB{IO}</CODE>.</P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="internal change: perlio abstraction interface">Internal change: PerlIO abstraction interface</A></H2>
<P>It is now possible to build Perl with AT&amp;T's sfio IO package
instead of stdio.  See <A HREF="../../lib/Pod/perlapio.html">the perlapio manpage</A> for more details, and
the <EM>INSTALL</EM> file for how to use it.</P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="new and changed syntax">New and changed syntax</A></H2>
<DL>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_%24coderef%2D%3E%28PARAMS%29">$coderef-&gt;(PARAMS)</A></STRONG><BR>
<DD>
A subroutine reference may now be suffixed with an arrow and a
(possibly empty) parameter list.  This syntax denotes a call of the
referenced subroutine, with the given parameters (if any).
<P>This new syntax follows the pattern of <CODE>$hashref-&gt;{FOO}</CODE> and
<CODE>$aryref-&gt;[$foo]</CODE>: You may now write <CODE>&amp;$subref($foo)</CODE> as
<CODE>$subref-&gt;($foo)</CODE>.  All these arrow terms may be chained;
thus, <CODE>&amp;{$table-&gt;{FOO}}($bar)</CODE> may now be written
<CODE>$table-&gt;{FOO}-&gt;($bar)</CODE>.</P>
<P></P></DL>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="new and changed builtin constants">New and changed builtin constants</A></H2>
<DL>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item___PACKAGE__">__PACKAGE__</A></STRONG><BR>
<DD>
The current package name at compile time, or the undefined value if
there is no current package (due to a <CODE>package;</CODE> directive).  Like
<CODE>__FILE__</CODE> and <CODE>__LINE__</CODE>, <A HREF="#item___PACKAGE__"><CODE>__PACKAGE__</CODE></A> does <EM>not</EM> interpolate

<H2><A NAME="new and changed builtin variables">New and changed builtin variables</A></H2>
<DL>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_%24%5EE">$^E</A></STRONG><BR>
<DD>
Extended error message on some platforms.  (Also known as
$EXTENDED_OS_ERROR if you <CODE>use English</CODE>).
<P></P>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_%24%5EH">$^H</A></STRONG><BR>
<DD>
The current set of syntax checks enabled by <CODE>use strict</CODE>.  See the
documentation of <CODE>strict</CODE> for more details.  Not actually new, but
newly documented.
Because it is intended for internal use by Perl core components,
there is no <CODE>use English</CODE> long name for this variable.
<P></P>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_%24%5EM">$^M</A></STRONG><BR>
<DD>
By default, running out of memory it is not trappable.  However, if
compiled for this, Perl may use the contents of <A HREF="#item_%24%5EM"><CODE>$^M</CODE></A> as an emergency
pool after die()ing with this message.  Suppose that your Perl were
compiled with -DPERL_EMERGENCY_SBRK and used Perl's malloc.  Then
<PRE>
    $^M = 'a' x (1&lt;&lt;16);</PRE>
<P>would allocate a 64K buffer for use when in emergency.
See the <EM>INSTALL</EM> file for information on how to enable this option.
As a disincentive to casual use of this advanced feature,
there is no <CODE>use English</CODE> long name for this variable.</P>
<P></P></DL>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="new and changed builtin functions">New and changed builtin functions</A></H2>
<DL>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_delete_on_slices">delete on slices</A></STRONG><BR>
<DD>
This now works.  (e.g. <CODE>delete @ENV{'PATH', 'MANPATH'}</CODE>)
<P></P>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_flock">flock</A></STRONG><BR>
<DD>
is now supported on more platforms, prefers fcntl to lockf when
emulating, and always flushes before (un)locking.
<P></P>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_printf_and_sprintf">printf and sprintf</A></STRONG><BR>
<DD>
Perl now implements these functions itself; it doesn't use the C
library function <A HREF="../../lib/Pod/perlfunc.html#item_sprintf"><CODE>sprintf()</CODE></A> any more, except for floating-point
numbers, and even then only known flags are allowed.  As a result, it
is now possible to know which conversions and flags will work, and
what they will do.
<P>The new conversions in Perl's <A HREF="../../lib/Pod/perlfunc.html#item_sprintf"><CODE>sprintf()</CODE></A> are:</P>
<PRE>
   %i   a synonym for %d
   %p   a pointer (the address of the Perl value, in hexadecimal)
   %n   special: *stores* the number of characters output so far
        into the next variable in the parameter list</PRE>
<P>The new flags that go between the <CODE>%</CODE> and the conversion are:</P>
<PRE>
   #    prefix octal with &quot;0&quot;, hex with &quot;0x&quot;
   h    interpret integer as C type &quot;short&quot; or &quot;unsigned short&quot;
   V    interpret integer as Perl's standard integer type</PRE>
<P>Also, where a number would appear in the flags, an asterisk (``*'') may
be used instead, in which case Perl uses the next item in the
parameter list as the given number (that is, as the field width or
precision).  If a field width obtained through ``*'' is negative, it has
the same effect as the '-' flag: left-justification.</P>
<P>See <A HREF="../../lib/Pod/perlfunc.html#sprintf">sprintf in the perlfunc manpage</A> for a complete list of conversion and flags.</P>
<P></P>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_keys_as_an_lvalue">keys as an lvalue</A></STRONG><BR>
<DD>
As an lvalue, <A HREF="../../lib/Pod/perlfunc.html#item_keys"><CODE>keys</CODE></A> allows you to increase the number of hash buckets
allocated for the given hash.  This can gain you a measure of efficiency if
you know the hash is going to get big.  (This is similar to pre-extending
an array by assigning a larger number to $#array.)  If you say
<PRE>
    keys %hash = 200;</PRE>
<P>then <CODE>%hash</CODE> will have at least 200 buckets allocated for it.  These

If the first argument to <A HREF="#item_use"><CODE>use</CODE></A> is a number, it is treated as a version
number instead of a module name.  If the version of the Perl interpreter
is less than VERSION, then an error message is printed and Perl exits

immediately during the compilation process, unlike <A HREF="../../lib/Pod/perlfunc.html#item_require"><CODE>require VERSION</CODE></A>,
which waits until runtime for the check.  This is often useful if you
need to check the current Perl version before <A HREF="#item_use"><CODE>use</CODE></A>ing library modules

comma after VERSION!)
<P>This version-checking mechanism is similar to the one currently used

Now, when perl sees that you're calling <A HREF="../../lib/Pod/perlfunc.html#item_rand"><CODE>rand</CODE></A> and haven't yet called

The <A HREF="../../lib/Pod/perlfunc.html#item_m/"><CODE>m//g</CODE></A> match iteration construct has always reset its target
string's search position (which is visible through the <A HREF="../../lib/Pod/perlfunc.html#item_pos"><CODE>pos</CODE></A> operator)
when a match fails; as a result, the next <A HREF="../../lib/Pod/perlfunc.html#item_m/"><CODE>m//g</CODE></A> match after a failure
starts again at the beginning of the string.  With Perl 5.004, this
reset may be disabled by adding the ``c'' (for ``continue'') modifier,
i.e. <A HREF="../../lib/Pod/perlfunc.html#item_m/"><CODE>m//gc</CODE></A>.  This feature, in conjunction with the <CODE>\G</CODE> zero-width

The <A HREF="../../lib/Pod/perlfunc.html#item_m/"><CODE>m//x</CODE></A> construct has always been intended to ignore all unescaped

Perl memory allocation is by bucket with sizes close to powers of two.
Because of these malloc overhead may be big, especially for data of

a slightly different algorithm for small allocations (up to 64 bytes
long), which makes it possible to have overhead down to 1 byte for
allocations which are powers of two (and appear quite often).
<P>Expected memory savings (with 8-byte alignment in <CODE>alignbytes</CODE>) is
about 20% for typical Perl usage.  Expected slowdown due to additional
malloc overhead is in fractions of a percent (hard to measure, because

Similarly to <CODE>PACK_MALLOC</CODE>, this macro improves allocations of data

(starting with 16K by default).  Such allocations are typical for big
hashes and special-purpose scripts, especially image processing.
<P>On recent systems, the fact that perl requires 2M from system for 1M
allocation will not affect speed of execution, since the tail of such
a chunk is not going to be touched (and thus will not require real
memory).  However, it may result in a premature out-of-memory error.
So if you will be manipulating very large blocks with sizes close to
powers of two, it would be wise to define this macro.</P>

The <EM>pod2html</EM> utility included with Perl 5.004 is entirely new.
By default, it sends the converted HTML to its standard output,

<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_void_XSUBs_now_default_to_returning_nothing"><CODE>void</CODE> XSUBs now default to returning nothing</A></STRONG><BR>
<DD>
Due to a documentation/implementation bug in previous versions of
Perl, XSUBs with a return type of <CODE>void</CODE> have actually been
returning one value.  Usually that value was the GV for the XSUB,
but sometimes it was some already freed or reused value, which would
sometimes lead to program failure.
<P>In Perl 5.004, if an XSUB is declared as returning <CODE>void</CODE>, it
actually returns no value, i.e. an empty list (though there is a
backward-compatibility exception; see below).  If your XSUB really
does return an SV, you should give it a return type of <CODE>SV *</CODE>.</P>
<P>For backward compatibility, <EM>xsubpp</EM> tries to guess whether a
<CODE>void</CODE> XSUB is really <CODE>void</CODE> or if it wants to return an <CODE>SV *</CODE>.
It does so by examining the text of the XSUB: if <EM>xsubpp</EM> finds
what looks like an assignment to <CODE>ST(0)</CODE>, it assumes that the
XSUB's return type is really <CODE>SV *</CODE>.</P>

<DD>
The <CODE>gv_fetchmethod</CODE> function finds a method for an object, just like
in Perl 5.003.  The GV it returns may be a method cache entry.
However, in Perl 5.004, method cache entries are not visible to users;
therefore, they can no longer be passed directly to <CODE>perl_call_sv</CODE>.
Instead, you should use the <CODE>GvCV</CODE> macro on the GV to extract its CV,
and pass the CV to <CODE>perl_call_sv</CODE>.
<P>The most likely symptom of passing the result of <CODE>gv_fetchmethod</CODE> to
<CODE>perl_call_sv</CODE> is Perl's producing an ``Undefined subroutine called''
error on the <EM>second</EM> call to a given method (since there is no cache
on the first call).</P>

<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_perl_eval_pv"><CODE>perl_eval_pv</CODE></A></STRONG><BR>

A new function handy for eval'ing strings of Perl code inside C code.
This function returns the value from the eval statement, which can
be used instead of fetching globals from the symbol table.  See
<A HREF="../../lib/Pod/perlguts.html">the perlguts manpage</A>, <A HREF="../../lib/Pod/perlembed.html">the perlembed manpage</A> and <A HREF="../../lib/Pod/perlcall.html">the perlcall manpage</A> for details and examples.

<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_Extended_API_for_manipulating_hashes">Extended API for manipulating hashes</A></STRONG><BR>
<DD>
Internal handling of hash keys has changed.  The old hashtable API is
still fully supported, and will likely remain so.  The additions to the
API allow passing keys as <CODE>SV*</CODE>s, so that <A HREF="../../lib/Pod/perlfunc.html#item_tied"><CODE>tied</CODE></A> hashes can be given
real scalars as keys rather than plain strings (nontied hashes still
can only use strings as keys).  New extensions must use the new hash
access functions and macros if they wish to use <CODE>SV*</CODE> keys.  These
additions also make it feasible to manipulate <CODE>HE*</CODE>s (hash entries),
which can be more efficient.  See <A HREF="../../lib/Pod/perlguts.html">the perlguts manpage</A> for details.

(W) A lexical variable has been redeclared in the same scope, effectively

<DD>
(W) The pattern match (//), substitution (s///), and transliteration (tr///)
operators work on scalar values.  If you apply one of them to an array
or a hash, it will convert the array or hash to a scalar value -- the
length of an array, or the population info of a hash -- and then work on
that scalar value.  This is probably not what you meant to do.  See
<A HREF="../../lib/Pod/perlfunc.html#grep">grep in the perlfunc manpage</A> and <A HREF="../../lib/Pod/perlfunc.html#map">map in the perlfunc manpage</A> for alternatives.

<DD>
(F) Perl optimizes the internal handling of sort subroutines and keeps
pointers into them.  You tried to redefine one such sort subroutine when it
was currently active, which is not allowed.  If you really want to do
this, you should write <CODE>sort { &amp;func } @x</CODE> instead of <CODE>sort func @x</CODE>.

<CODE>$A::B</CODE>).  You've exceeded Perl's limits.  Future versions of Perl are
likely to eliminate these arbitrary limitations.

<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_s">Illegal character %s (carriage return)</A></STRONG><BR>
<DD>
(F) A carriage return character was found in the input.  This is an

<DD>
(P) Something went wrong with the external <CODE>program(s)</CODE> used for <A HREF="#item_glob"><CODE>glob</CODE></A>
and <CODE>&lt;*.c&gt;</CODE>.  This may mean that your csh (C shell) is
broken.  If so, you should change all of the csh-related variables in
config.sh:  If you have tcsh, make the variables refer to it as if it
were csh (e.g. <CODE>full_csh='/usr/bin/tcsh'</CODE>); otherwise, make them all
empty (except that <CODE>d_csh</CODE> should be <CODE>'undef'</CODE>) so that Perl will
think csh is missing.  In either case, after editing config.sh, run
<CODE>./Configure -S</CODE> and rebuild Perl.

<DD>
(X|F) The <CODE>malloc()</CODE> function returned 0, indicating there was insufficient
remaining memory (or virtual memory) to satisfy the request.
<P>The request was judged to be small, so the possibility to trap it
depends on the way Perl was compiled.  By default it is not trappable.
However, if compiled for this, Perl may use the contents of <A HREF="#item_%24%5EM"><CODE>$^M</CODE></A> as
an emergency pool after die()ing with this message.  In this case the
error is trappable <EM>once</EM>.</P>
<P></P>

<DD>
(F) The <CODE>malloc()</CODE> function returned 0, indicating there was insufficient
remaining memory (or virtual memory) to satisfy the request. However,
the request was judged large enough (compile-time default is 64K), so

<DT><STRONG>Possible attempt to put comments in <CODE>qw()</CODE> list</STRONG><BR>
<DD>
(W) <A HREF="#item_qw"><CODE>qw()</CODE></A> lists contain items separated by whitespace; as with literal
strings, comment characters are not ignored, but are instead treated
as literal data.  (You may have used different delimiters than the
parentheses shown here; braces are also frequently used.)
<P>You probably wrote something like this:</P>
<PRE>
    @list = qw(
        a # a comment
        b # another comment
    );</PRE>
<P>when you should have written this:</P>
<PRE>
    @list = qw(
        a
        b
    );</PRE>
<P>If you really want comments, build your list the
old-fashioned way, with quotes and commas:</P>
<PRE>
    @list = (
        'a',    # a comment
        'b',    # another comment
    );</PRE>

<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_Possible_attempt_to_separate_words_with_commas">Possible attempt to separate words with commas</A></STRONG><BR>
<DD>
(W) <A HREF="#item_qw"><CODE>qw()</CODE></A> lists contain items separated by whitespace; therefore commas
aren't needed to separate the items. (You may have used different
delimiters than the parentheses shown here; braces are also frequently
used.)
<P>You probably wrote something like this:</P>
<PRE>
    qw! a, b, c !;</PRE>
<P>which puts literal commas into some of the list items.  Write it without
commas if you don't want them to appear in your data:</P>

<DD>
(W) You've used a hash slice (indicated by @) to select a single element of
a hash.  Generally it's better to ask for a scalar value (indicated by $).
The difference is that <CODE>$foo{&amp;bar}</CODE> always behaves like a scalar, both when
assigning to it and when evaluating its argument, while <CODE>@foo{&amp;bar}</CODE> behaves
like a list when you assign to it, and provides a list context to its
subscript, which can do weird things if you're expecting only one subscript.

(P) Overloading resolution over @ISA tree may be broken by importing stubs.
Stubs should never be implicitly created, but explicit calls to <A HREF="#item_can"><CODE>can</CODE></A>

<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_Too_late_for_%22%2DT%22_option">Too late for ``<STRONG>-T</STRONG>'' option</A></STRONG><BR>
<DD>
(X) The #! line (or local equivalent) in a Perl script contains the
<STRONG>-T</STRONG> option, but Perl was not invoked with <STRONG>-T</STRONG> in its argument
list.  This is an error because, by the time Perl discovers a <STRONG>-T</STRONG> in
a script, it's too late to properly taint everything from the
environment.  So Perl gives up.
<P></P>

<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_Unrecognized_character_%25s">Unrecognized character %s</A></STRONG><BR>

(F) The Perl parser has no idea what to do with the specified character

script, a binary program, or a directory as a Perl program.
<P></P>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_Unsupported_function_fork">Unsupported function fork</A></STRONG><BR>
<DD>
(F) Your version of executable does not support forking.
<P>Note that under some systems, like OS/2, there may be different flavors of
Perl executables, some of which may support fork, some not. Try changing
the name you call Perl by to <CODE>perl_</CODE>, <CODE>perl__</CODE>, and so on.</P>

<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_Use_of_%22%24%24%3Cdigit%3E%22_to_mean_%22%24%7B%2">Use of ``$$&lt;digit&gt;'' to mean ``${$}&lt;digit&gt;'' is deprecated</A></STRONG><BR>
<DD>
(D) Perl versions before 5.004 misinterpreted any type marker followed
by ``$'' and a digit.  For example, ``$$0'' was incorrectly taken to mean
``${$}0'' instead of ``${$0}''.  This bug is (mostly) fixed in Perl 5.004.
<P>However, the developers of Perl 5.004 could not fix this bug completely,
because at least two widely-used modules depend on the old meaning of
``$$0'' in a string.  So Perl 5.004 still interprets ``$$&lt;digit&gt;'' in the
old (broken) way inside strings; but it generates this message as a
warning.  And in Perl 5.005, this special treatment will cease.</P>

<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_defined">Value of %s can be ``0''; test with <CODE>defined()</CODE></A></STRONG><BR>

(W) In a conditional expression, you used &lt;HANDLE&gt;, &lt;*&gt; (glob), <A HREF="../../lib/Pod/perlfunc.html#item_each"><CODE>each()</CODE></A>,
or <A HREF="../../lib/Pod/perlfunc.html#item_readdir"><CODE>readdir()</CODE></A> as a boolean value.  Each of these constructs can return a
value of ``0''; that would make the conditional expression false, which is
probably not what you intended.  When using these constructs in conditional
expressions, test their values with the <A HREF="#item_defined"><CODE>defined</CODE></A> operator.
<P></P>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_Variable_%22%25s%22_may_be_unavailable">Variable ``%s'' may be unavailable</A></STRONG><BR>
<DD>
(W) An inner (nested) <EM>anonymous</EM> subroutine is inside a <EM>named</EM>
subroutine, and outside that is another subroutine; and the anonymous
(innermost) subroutine is referencing a lexical variable defined in
the outermost subroutine.  For example:
<PRE>
   sub outermost { my $a; sub middle { sub { $a } } }</PRE>
<P>If the anonymous subroutine is called or referenced (directly or
indirectly) from the outermost subroutine, it will share the variable
as you would expect.  But if the anonymous subroutine is called or
referenced when the outermost subroutine is not active, it will see
the value of the shared variable as it was before and during the
*first* call to the outermost subroutine, which is probably not what
you want.</P>
<P>In these circumstances, it is usually best to make the middle
subroutine anonymous, using the <A HREF="../../lib/Pod/perlfunc.html#item_sub"><CODE>sub {}</CODE></A> syntax.  Perl has specific
support for shared variables in nested anonymous subroutines; a named
subroutine in between interferes with this feature.</P>
<P></P>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_Variable_%22%25s%22_will_not_stay_shared">Variable ``%s'' will not stay shared</A></STRONG><BR>
<DD>
(W) An inner (nested) <EM>named</EM> subroutine is referencing a lexical
variable defined in an outer subroutine.
<P>When the inner subroutine is called, it will probably see the value of
the outer subroutine's variable as it was before and during the
*first* call to the outer subroutine; in this case, after the first
call to the outer subroutine is complete, the inner and outer
subroutines will no longer share a common value for the variable.  In
other words, the variable will no longer be shared.</P>
<P>Furthermore, if the outer subroutine is anonymous and references a
lexical variable outside itself, then the outer and inner subroutines
will <EM>never</EM> share the given variable.</P>
<P>This problem can usually be solved by making the inner subroutine
anonymous, using the <A HREF="../../lib/Pod/perlfunc.html#item_sub"><CODE>sub {}</CODE></A> syntax.  When inner anonymous subs that
reference variables in outer subroutines are called or referenced,
they are automatically rebound to the current values of such
variables.</P>

(W) You passed <A HREF="../../lib/Pod/perlfunc.html#item_warn"><CODE>warn()</CODE></A> an empty string (the equivalent of <CODE>warn &quot;&quot;</CODE>) or
you called it with no args and <A HREF="../../lib/Pod/perlvar.html#item_%24_"><CODE>$_</CODE></A> was empty.

<DD>
(W) A warning peculiar to VMS.  A logical name was encountered when preparing
to iterate over %ENV which violates the syntactic rules governing logical
names.  Since it cannot be translated normally, it is skipped, and will not
appear in %ENV.  This may be a benign occurrence, as some software packages
might directly modify logical name tables and introduce nonstandard names,
or it may indicate that a logical name table has been corrupted.
