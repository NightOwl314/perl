<P>
<H2><A NAME="build 626 thursday, may 1, 2001">Build 626 Thursday, May 1, 2001</A></H2>
<P>Build 626 is based on Perl 5.6.1.  This is the first release of ActivePerl
based on this new maintenance release of Perl.  This release is meant for
use in production systems.  However, owing to the sheer volume of changes
between Perl 5.6.0 and 5.6.1 that have been incorporated, please be sure
to test it thoroughly in a non-critical environment before you upgrade
your production systems.</P>
<P>Please check the <EM>perldelta.pod</EM> file in the Perl source distribution for
a list of the major changes in Perl.  Only additional changes specific to
ActivePerl are mentioned here.</P>

Bug fixes imported from the Perl development track.  See the following file
for the detailed log:
<PRE>
    <A HREF="http://www.ActiveState.com/download/ActivePerl/src/5.6/AP618_diff.txt">http://www.ActiveState.com/download/ActivePerl/src/5.6/AP618_diff.txt</A></PRE>
<P>Individual patches for each of these changes may also be obtained.  See
<EM>perlhack</EM>.</P>
<P></P>
<LI>
Perl's <CODE>newSVrv()</CODE> API function could result in corrupt data when coercing an
already initialized value to the right type, and could also lead to memory
leaks.  Win32::OLE v0.14 tickled these bugs.  <CODE>newSVrv()</CODE> has been fixed to
resolve these issues.
<P></P>
<LI>
Perl's optimizer could coredump on stacked assignments involving <CODE>split()</CODE>,
such as <CODE>@a = @b = split(...)</CODE>.  This is now fixed.
<P></P>
<LI>
Windows sockets weren't being initialized correctly in child threads if the
parent already initialized it.  This resulted in <CODE>print()</CODE> on a socket
created under such conditions not being handled correctly (whereas <CODE>send()</CODE>
would do the right thing).  The problem has been fixed.
<P></P>
<LI>
Win32::OLE v0.14 had a bug that could cause strings longer than 256 characters
to be truncated by a single character.  This has been corrected.
<P></P></UL>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="build 617 thursday, august 31, 2000">Build 617 Thursday, August 31, 2000</A></H2>

<P>Individual patches for each of these changes may also be obtained.  See
<EM>perlhack</EM>.</P>
<P></P>
<LI>
Problems with backticks not returning a proper return code under Windows 9x
have been fixed.  Linux, Solaris and Windows NT/2000 weren't affected.
<P></P>
<LI>
<CODE>wait()</CODE> and <CODE>waitpid()</CODE> now return the correct pid values for pseudo-pids on
Windows.
<P></P>
<LI>
New entries added to the end of the environment via <CODE>%ENV</CODE> did not get
inherited by child processes on Windows.  This has been corrected.
<P></P>
<LI>
Build 616 introduced a change that could make <CODE>close(SOCKET)</CODE> return a bogus
return value.  This has been corrected.
<P></P>
<LI>
Various minor PerlScript incompatibilities under Internet Explorer 5.5
on Windows have been corrected.
<P></P>
<LI>
Perl for ISAPI and PerlScript do not add entries to the EventLog by default.
<P></P>
<LI>
libnet v1.06 is now included with ActivePerl.  To configure the site-specific
defaults for libnet, run <CODE>$Config{installprefix}/bin/libnetcfg.pl</CODE>.
<P></P>
<LI>
Digest-MD5 v2.11 is now included with ActivePerl.
<P></P>
<LI>
Several bundled extensions have been upgraded to newer versions. URI v1.09,
libwww-perl v5.48, Compress-Zlib v1.08 and libwin32 v0.17 are now included.
<P></P>
<LI>
The included HTML documentation has been improved and updated to be current
with the latest modules.
<P></P>
<LI>
The HtmlHelp.pm module is no longer included with ActivePerl.  If you want
this module, please obtain it from a release prior to ActivePerl 617.

<P></P>
<LI>
A bug in Win32::OLE that prevented PerlScript from working properly
has been fixed.
<P></P>
<LI>
On Windows, a small memory leak in the <CODE>accept()</CODE> builtin function has
been fixed.
<P></P>
<LI>
On Windows, creating sockets in pseudo-child processes did not work
because Winsock was not initialized in the pseudo-process.  This has
been rectified.

<P>Individual patches for each of these changes may also be obtained.  See
<EM>perlhack</EM>.</P>
<P></P>
<LI>
On Unix platforms, ActivePerl is now built with the <CODE>-Duseithreads</CODE>
Configure option, just as on Windows.  While this provides a functionally
identical perl, it also makes this build binary incompatible with earlier
builds on Unix platforms.  If you had installed any extensions (i.e. modules
with XS code) using earlier builds via PPM or otherwise, you will need
to reinstall them under this build.  Future builds will maintain binary
compatibility with this one.
<P>On Windows, this build continues to be binary compatible with build 613.</P>
<P></P>
<LI>
The installation location for the native installations on Unix (Red Hat
RPM, Debian dpkg, or Solaris pkgadd) have changed.  These packages will
now be installed under /usr/local/ActivePerl-5.6/ rather than under
/usr/local/perl-5.6.  This one-time change avoids confusion with locally
installed versions built from the sources, and also avoids installing
on top of existing binary-incompatible build 613 installations.
<P>The installation location can be chosen as usual on Windows, and when
installing using the generic installers on Unix.</P>
<P></P>
<LI>
On Windows, <CODE>chdir()</CODE> could sometimes fail to return failure when given a
non-existent directory, and UNC paths didn't work correctly.  These
problems have been corrected.
<P></P>
<LI>
The <CODE>libwin32</CODE> v0.16 release from CPAN is included for the Windows
builds.
<P></P>
<LI>
Various small PPM bugs have been fixed.
<P></P>
<LI>
A bug in PerlScript that prevented it from working under IIS5 on
Windows 2000 has been fixed.

<CODE>binmode()</CODE> now supports a second optional argument that can be used
to switch a file handle to ``:crlf'' or ``:raw'' mode.  (These correspond
to the traditional text and binary modes.)  See <EM>perlfunc/binmode</EM>.
<P></P>
<LI>
The new <CODE>open</CODE> pragma can be used to set the default mode for
implicitly opened handles in the current lexical scope.  This is
useful to set a particular mode for the results of the qx//
operator.  See <EM>open</EM>.
<P></P>
<LI>
The bundled ActivePerl documentation has been reorganized.  Outdated
material has either been reworked to reflect the current status, or
removed when it was no longer applicable.

Support for Unicode has changed from previous development versions. See

the wide-character APIs.  This can also be used in the shebang line.

NOTE:Build 603 is not binary compatible with earlier builds. If you have
compiled your own extensions with earlier builds, you will need to recompile
all of them.

Build 603 corresponds to Perl 5.005_62. Additional patches available
since 5.005_62 in the public Perl repository have been incorporated.

This build features a major reworking of the API exposed by the
PERL_OBJECT build option. The result is a well-defined Perl API (restricted to
C syntax) that provides very high degree of compatibility for extensions
available from CPAN.
<P></P>
<LI>
Perl for ISAPI, PerlScript, PerlEz and PerlMsg have been modified to use
the new PERL_OBJECT API.
<P></P>
<LI>
Visual Package Manager (VPM) is now available. VPM can be used to install
pre-built binaries from a package repository. One such is available at

<LI>
This series is built around development versions of Perl 5.006. Build 600
corresponds to Perl 5.005_57.
<P></P>
<LI>
Significant changes that have occurred in the
5.006 development track are documented in perldelta.
<P></P>
<LI>
Build 600 includes additional changes for supporting globalization.  All
Win32 API calls made by Perl now follow the utf8 mode of the interpreter.
Wide versions of the API calls are made when utf8 is in effect.  See utf8
for more information on enabling support for Unicode.
<P></P>
<LI>
The 600 series is not binary compatible with builds in the 500 series. Any
extensions built using binaries from the ActivePerl 500 series will need
to be recompiled.  Note especially that this applies to PPDs that may have
been built for 500 series builds.
