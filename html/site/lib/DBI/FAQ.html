<P>To quote Tim Bunce, the architect and author of DBI:</P>
<PRE>
    ``DBI is a database access Application Programming Interface (API)
      for the Perl Language. The DBI API Specification defines a set
      of functions, variables and conventions that provide a consistent
      database interface independant of the actual database being used.''</PRE>
<P>In simple language, the DBI interface allows users to access multiple database
types transparently. So, if you connecting to an Oracle, Informix, mSQL, Sybase
or whatever database, you don't need to know the underlying mechanics of the
3GL layer. The API defined by DBI will work on <EM>all</EM> these database types.</P>
<P>A similar benefit is gained by the ability to connect to two <EM>different</EM>
databases of different vendor within the one perl script, <EM>ie</EM>, I want
to read data from an Oracle database and insert it back into an Informix
database all within one program. The DBI layer allows you to do this simply
and powerfully.</P>
Here's a diagram that demonstrates the principle:
<P>
<CENTER>
<IMG SRC="img/dbiarch.gif" WIDTH=451 HEIGHT=321 ALT="[ DBI Architecture ]">
</CENTER>
<P><P><EM>DBperl</EM> is the old name for the interface specification. It's usually
now used to denote perl<EM>4</EM> modules on database interfacing, such as,
<EM>oraperl</EM>, <EM>isqlperl</EM>, <EM>ingperl</EM> and so on. These interfaces
didn't have a standard API and are generally <EM>not</EM> supported.</P>
<P>Here's a list of DBperl modules, their corresponding DBI counterparts and
support information. <EM>Please note</EM>, the author's listed here generally
<EM>do not</EM> maintain the DBI module for the same database. These email
addresses are unverified and should only be used for queries concerning the
perl4 modules listed below. DBI driver queries should be directed to the

<P>However, some DBI modules have DBperl emulation layers, so, <EM>DBD::Oracle</EM>
comes with an Oraperl emulation layer, which allows you to run legacy oraperl
scripts without modification. The emulation layer translates the oraperl API
calls into DBI calls and executes them through the DBI switch.</P>

<DD>
<EM>POD</EM>s are chunks of documentation usually embedded within perl programs
that document the code ``<EM>in place</EM>'', providing a useful resource for
programmers and users of modules. POD for DBI and drivers is beginning to
become more commonplace, and documentation for these modules can be read
with the <CODE>perldoc</CODE> program included with Perl.
<DL>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_The_DBI_Specification">The DBI Specification</A></STRONG><BR>
<DD>
The POD for the DBI Specification can be read with the:
<PRE>
    perldoc DBI</PRE>
<P>command. The Specification also forms Appendix A of ``Programming the Perl
DBI''.</P>
<P></P>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_Oraperl">Oraperl</A></STRONG><BR>
<DD>
Users of the Oraperl emulation layer bundled with <EM>DBD::Oracle</EM>, may read
up on how to program with the Oraperl interface by typing:
<PRE>
    perldoc Oraperl</PRE>
<P>This will produce an updated copy of the original oraperl man page written by
Kevin Stock for perl4. The oraperl API is fully listed and described there.</P>
<P></P>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_Drivers">Drivers</A></STRONG><BR>
<DD>
Users of the DBD modules may read about some of the private functions
and quirks of that driver by typing:
<PRE>
    perldoc &lt;driver&gt;</PRE>
<P>For example, the <EM>DBD::mSQL</EM> driver is bundled with driver-specific
documentation that can be accessed by typing</P>
<PRE>
    perldoc DBD::mSQL</PRE>
<P></P>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_Frequently_Asked_Questions">Frequently Asked Questions</A></STRONG><BR>
<DD>
This document, the <EM>Frequently Asked Questions</EM> is also available as POD
documentation! You can read this on your own system by typing:
<PRE>
    perldoc DBI::FAQ</PRE>
<P>This may be more convenient to persons not permanently, or conveniently,
connected to the Internet. The <EM>DBI::FAQ</EM> module should be downloaded and
installed for the more up-to-date version.</P>
<P>The version of <EM>DBI::FAQ</EM> shipped with the <CODE>DBI</CODE> module may be slightly out
of date.</P>
<P></P>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_POD_in_general">POD in general</A></STRONG><BR>
<DD>
Information on writing POD, and on the philosophy of POD in general, can be
read by typing:
<PRE>
    perldoc perlpod</PRE>
<P>Users with the Tk module installed may be interested to learn there is a
Tk-based POD reader available called <CODE>tkpod</CODE>, which formats POD in a convenient
and readable way. This is available <EM>via</EM> CPAN as the module called
<EM>Tk::POD</EM> and is highly recommended.</P>

<P>in the driver information table. These summaries contain standardised
information on each driver and database which should aid you in selecting
a database to use. It will also inform you quickly of any issues within
drivers or whether a driver is not fully compliant with the DBI Specification.</P>

<P>There are a series of occasional rambles from various people on the
DBI mailing lists who, in an attempt to clear up a simple point, end up
drafting fairly comprehensive documents. These are quite often varying in
quality, but do provide some insights into the workings of the interfaces.</P>

<H2><A NAME="3.1 what's the difference between odbc and dbi">3.1 What's the difference between ODBC and DBI?</A></H2>
<P>In terms of architecture - not much: Both define programming
interfaces. Both allow multiple drivers to be loaded to do the
actual work.</P>
<P>In terms of ease of use - much: The DBI is a 'high level' interface
that, like Perl itself, strives to make the simple things easy while
still making the hard things possible. The ODBC is a 'low level'
interface. All nuts-bolts-knobs-and-dials.</P>
<P>Now there's an ODBC driver for the DBI (DBD::ODBC) the ``What's the
difference'' question is more usefully rephrased as:</P>
<P>Chapter 7 of ``Programming the Perl DBI'' covers this topic in far more
detail and should be consulted.</P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="3.2 what's the difference between win32::odbc and dbd::odbc">3.2 What's the difference between Win32::ODBC and DBD::ODBC?</A></H2>
<P>The DBI, and thus DBD::ODBC, has a different philosophy from the
Win32::ODBC module:</P>
<P>The Win32::ODBC module is a 'thin' layer over the low-level ODBC API.
The DBI defines a simpler 'higher level' interface.</P>
<P>The Win32::ODBC module gives you access to more of the ODBC API.
The DBI and DBD::ODBC give you access to only the essentials.
(But, unlike Win32::ODBC, the DBI and DBD::ODBC do support parameter
binding and multiple prepared statements which reduces the load on
the database server and can dramatically increase performance.)</P>
<P>The Win32::ODBC module only works on Win32 systems.
The DBI and DBD::ODBC are very portable and work on Win32 and Unix.</P>
<P>The DBI and DBD::ODBC modules are supplied as a standard part of the
Perl 5.004 binary distribution for Win32 (they don't work with the
older, non-standard, ActiveState port).</P>
<P>Scripts written with the DBI and DBD::ODBC are faster than Win32::ODBC
on Win32 and are trivially portable to other supported database types.</P>
<P>The DBI offers optional automatic printing or die()ing on errors which
makes applications simpler and more robust.</P>
<P>The current DBD::ODBC driver version 0.16 is new and not yet fully stable.
A new release is due soon [relative to the date of the next TPJ issue :-]
and will be much improved and offer more ODBC functionality.</P>
<P>To summarise: The Win32::ODBC module is your best choice if you need
access to more of the ODBC API than the DBI gives you. Otherwise, the
DBI and DBD::ODBC combination may be your best bet.</P>
<P>Chapter 7 of ``Programming the Perl DBI'' covers this topic in far more
detail and should be consulted.</P>

<EM>DBI</EM> and <EM>DBD::ODBC</EM> under these platforms, and, with the
advent of a stabler perl and a port of <EM>MakeMaker</EM>, the project has
come on by great leaps and bounds.</P>
<P>The <EM>DBI</EM> and <EM>DBD::Oracle</EM> Win32 ports are now a standard part of DBI,
so, downloading <EM>DBI</EM> of version higher than <EM>0.81</EM> should work fine as

<P>If not, no. A complete absence of a given database driver from that

such a driver is impossible to write.</P>
<P>A corollary of the above statement implies that if you see an announcement

<H2><A NAME="3.6 what's dbm and why should i use dbi instead">3.6 What's DBM? And why should I use DBI instead?</A></H2>
<P>Extracted from ``<EM>DBI - The Database Interface for Perl 5</EM>'':</P>
<PRE>
    ``UNIX was originally blessed with simple file-based ``databases'', namely
    the dbm system. dbm lets you store data in files, and retrieve
    that data quickly. However, it also has serious drawbacks.</PRE>
<PRE>
        File Locking</PRE>
<PRE>
        The dbm systems did not allow particularly robust file locking
        capabilities, nor any capability for correcting problems arising through
        simultaneous writes [ to the database ].</PRE>
<PRE>
        Arbitrary Data Structures</PRE>
<PRE>
        The dbm systems only allows a single fixed data structure:
        key-value pairs. That value could be a complex object, such as a
        [ C ] struct, but the key had to be unique. This was a large
        limitation on the usefulness of dbm systems.</PRE>
<PRE>
    However, dbm systems still provide a useful function for users with
    simple datasets and limited resources, since they are fast, robust and
    extremely well-tested. Perl modules to access dbm systems have now
    been integrated into the core Perl distribution via the
    AnyDBM_File module.''</PRE>
<P>To sum up, DBM is a perfectly satisfactory solution for essentially read-only
databases, or small and simple datasets. However, for more
scaleable dataset handling, not to mention robust transactional locking,
users are recommended to use a more powerful database engine <EM>via</EM> <EM>DBI</EM>.</P>
<P>Chapter 2 of ``Programming the Perl DBI'' discusses DBM files in detail.</P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="3.7 what database do you recommend me using">3.7 What database do you recommend me using?</A></H2>
<P>This is a particularly thorny area in which an objective answer is difficult
to come by, since each dataset, proposed usage and system configuration
differs from person to person.</P>
<P>From the current author's point of view, if the dataset is relatively
small, being tables of less than 1 million rows, and less than 1000 tables
in a given database, then <EM>mSQL</EM> is a perfectly acceptable solution
to your problem. This database is extremely cheap, is wonderfully robust
and has excellent support. More information is available on the Hughes
Technology WWW site at:</P>

    <A HREF="http://www.hughes.com.au">http://www.hughes.com.au</A></PRE>

that has a similar feel to mSQL.</P>

<P>If the dataset is larger than 1 million row tables or 1000 tables, or if you

Oracle's WWW site is an excellent source of more information.</P>

    <A HREF="http://www.informix.com">http://www.informix.com</A></PRE>
<P>In the case of WWW fronted applications, <EM>mSQL</EM> may be a better option

<P>In a word, yes! DBI is hugely useful for CGI programming! In fact, I would
tentatively say that CGI programming is one of two top uses for DBI.</P>
<P>DBI confers the ability to CGI programmers to power WWW-fronted databases
to their users, which provides users with vast quantities of ordered
data to play with. DBI also provides the possibility that, if a site is
receiving far too much traffic than their database server can cope with, they
can upgrade the database server behind the scenes with no alterations to
the CGI scripts.</P>

<P>Basically, a good chance this is occurring is due to the fact that the user
that you ran it from the command line as has a correctly configured set of
environment variables, in the case of <EM>DBD::Oracle</EM>, variables like
<CODE>ORACLE_HOME</CODE>, <CODE>ORACLE_SID</CODE> or <CODE>TWO_TASK</CODE>.</P>
<P>The <CODE>httpd</CODE> process usually runs under the user id of <CODE>nobody</CODE>,
which implies there is no configured environment. Any scripts attempting to
execute in this situation will correctly fail.</P>
<P>One way to solve this problem is to set the environment for your database in a
<CODE>BEGIN { }</CODE> block at the top of your script. Another technique is to configure
your WWW server to pass-through certain environment variables to your CGI
scripts.</P>
<P>Similarly, you should check your <CODE>httpd</CODE> error logfile for any clues,

<P>Perl version 5.005 and later can be built to support multi-threading.
The DBI, as of version 1.02, does not yet support multi-threading
so it would be unsafe to let more than one thread enter the DBI at

<P>It is expected that some future version of the DBI will at least be
thread-safe (but not thread-hot) by automatically blocking threads

<P>For some OCI example code for Oracle that has multi-threaded <CODE>SELECT</CODE>
statements, see:</P>

<P>
<H2><A NAME="5.2 how do i handle blob data with dbi">5.2 How do I handle BLOB data with DBI?</A></H2>
<P>Handling BLOB data with the DBI is very straight-forward. BLOB columns are
specified in a SELECT statement as per normal columns. However, you also
need to specify a maximum BLOB size that the &lt;I&gt;database handle&lt;/I&gt; can
fetch using the <CODE>LongReadLen</CODE> attribute.</P>
<P>For example:</P>
<PRE>
    ### $dbh is a connected database handle
    $sth = $dbh-&gt;prepare( &quot;SELECT blob_column FROM blobby_table&quot; );
    $sth-&gt;execute;</PRE>
<P>would fail.</P>
<PRE>
    ### $dbh is a connected database handle
    ### Set the maximum BLOB size...
    $dbh-&gt;{LongReadLen} = 16384;        ### 16Kb...Not much of a BLOB!</PRE>
<PRE>
    $sth = $dbh-&gt;prepare( &quot;...&quot; );</PRE>
<P>would succeed &lt;I&gt;provided no column values were larger than the specified
value&lt;/I&gt;.</P>
<P>If the BLOB data is longer than the value of <CODE>LongReadLen</CODE>, then an
error will occur. However, the DBI provides an additional piece of
functionality that will automatically truncate the fetched BLOB to the
size of <CODE>LongReadLen</CODE> if it is longer. This does not cause an error to
occur, but may make your fetched BLOB data useless.</P>
<P>This behaviour is regulated by the <CODE>LongTruncOk</CODE> attribute which is
defaultly set to a false value ( thus making overlong BLOB fetches fail ).</P>
<PRE>
    ### Set BLOB handling such that it's 16Kb and can be truncated
    $dbh-&gt;{LongReadLen} = 16384;
    $dbh-&gt;{LongTruncOk} = 1;</PRE>
<P>Truncation of BLOB data may not be a big deal in cases where the BLOB
contains run-length encoded data, but data containing checksums at the end,
for example, a ZIP file, would be rendered useless.</P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="5.3 how can i invoke stored procedures with dbi">5.3 How can I invoke stored procedures with DBI?</A></H2>
<P>The DBI does not define a database-independent way of calling stored procedures.</P>
<P>However, most database that support them also provide a way to call
them from SQL statements - and the DBI certainly supports that.</P>
<P>So, assuming that you have created a stored procedure within the target
database, <EM>eg</EM>, an Oracle database, you can use <CODE>$dbh</CODE>-&gt;<CODE>do()</CODE> to
immediately execute the procedure. For example,</P>
<PRE>
    $dbh-&gt;do( &quot;BEGIN someProcedure; END;&quot; );   # Oracle-specific</PRE>
<P>You should also be able to <CODE>prepare</CODE> and <CODE>execute</CODE>, which is
the recommended way if you'll be calling the procedure often.</P>

<H2><A NAME="5.5 how can i create or drop a database with dbi">5.5 How can I create or drop a database with DBI?</A></H2>
<P>Database creation and deletion are concepts that are entirely too abstract
to be adequately supported by DBI. For example, Oracle does not support the
concept of dropping a database at all! Also, in Oracle, the database
<EM>server</EM> essentially <EM>is</EM> the database, whereas in mSQL, the
server process runs happily without any databases created in it. The
problem is too disparate to attack in a worthwhile way.</P>
<P>Some drivers, therefore, support database creation and deletion through
the private <CODE>func()</CODE> methods. You should check the documentation for
the drivers you are using to see if they support this mechanism.</P>

<P><CODE>NULL</CODE> values in DBI are specified to be treated as the value <CODE>undef</CODE>.
<CODE>NULL</CODE>s can be inserted into databases as <CODE>NULL</CODE>, for example:</P>
<PRE>
    $rv = $dbh-&gt;do( &quot;INSERT INTO table VALUES( NULL )&quot; );</PRE>

<H2><A NAME="5.8 what are these func() methods all about">5.8 What are these <CODE>func()</CODE> methods all about?</A></H2>
<P>The <CODE>func()</CODE> method is defined within DBI as being an entry point
for database-specific functionality, <EM>eg</EM>, the ability to create or
drop databases. Invoking these driver-specific methods is simple, for example,
to invoke a <CODE>createDatabase</CODE> method that has one argument, we would
write:</P>
<PRE>
    $rv =$dbh-&gt;func( 'argument', 'createDatabase' );</PRE>
