<H2><A NAME="changes in dbi 1.35, 7th march 2003">Changes in DBI 1.35,    7th March 2003</A></H2>
<PRE>
  Fixed memory leak in fetchrow_hashref introduced in DBI 1.33.
  Fixed various DBD::Proxy errors introduced in DBI 1.33.
  Fixed to ANSI C in dbd_dr_data_sources thanks to Jonathan Leffler.
  Fixed $h-&gt;can($method_name) to return correct code ref.
  Removed DBI::Format from distribution as it's now part of the
    separate DBI::Shell distribution by Tom Lowery.
  Updated DBI::DBD docs with a note about the CLONE method.
  Updated DBI::DBD docs thanks to Jonathan Leffler.
  Updated DBI::DBD::Metadata for perl 5.5.3 thanks to Jonathan Leffler.
  Added note to install_method docs about setup_driver() method.</PRE>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="changes in dbi 1.34, 28th february 2003">Changes in DBI 1.34,    28th February 2003</A></H2>
<PRE>
  Fixed DBI::DBD docs to refer to DBI::DBD::Metadata thanks to Jonathan Leffler.
  Fixed dbi_time() compile using BorlandC on Windows thanks to Steffen Goeldner.
  Fixed profile tests to do enough work to measure on Windows.
  Fixed disconnect_all() to not be required by drivers.</PRE>
<PRE>
  Added $okay = $h-&gt;can($method_name) to check if a method exists.
  Added DBD::*::*-&gt;install_method($method_name, \%attr) so driver private
    methods can be 'installed' into the DBI dispatcher and no longer
    need to be called using $h-&gt;func(..., $method_name).</PRE>
<PRE>
  Enhanced $dbh-&gt;clone() and documentation.
  Enhanced docs to note that dbi_time(), and thus profiling, is limited
    to only millisecond (seconds/1000) resolution on Windows.
  Removed old DBI::Shell from distribution and added Tom Lowery's improved
    version to the Bundle::DBI file.
  Updated minimum version numbers for modules in Bundle::DBI.</PRE>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="changes in dbi 1.33, 27th february 2003">Changes in DBI 1.33,    27th February 2003</A></H2>
<PRE>
  NOTE: Future versions of the DBI *will not* support perl 5.6.0 or earlier.
  : Perl 5.6.1 will be the minimum supported version.</PRE>
<PRE>
  NOTE: The &quot;old-style&quot; connect: DBI-&gt;connect($database, $user, $pass, $driver);
  : has been deprecated for several years and will now generate a warning.
  : It will be removed in a later release. Please change any old connect() calls.</PRE>
<PRE>
  Added $dbh2 = $dbh1-&gt;clone to make a new connection to the database
    that is identical to the original one. clone() can be called even after
    the original handle has been disconnected. See the docs for more details.</PRE>
<PRE>
  Fixed merging of profile data to not sum DBIprof_FIRST_TIME values.
  Fixed unescaping of newlines in DBI::ProfileData thanks to Sam Tregar.
  Fixed Taint bug with fetchrow_hashref with help from Bradley Baetz.
  Fixed $dbh-&gt;{Active} for DBD::Proxy, reported by Bob Showalter.
  Fixed STORE to not clear error during nested DBI call,
    thanks to Tony Bowden for the report and helpful test case.
  Fixed DBI::PurePerl error clearing behaviour.
  Fixed dbi_time() and thus DBI::Profile on Windows thanks to Smejkal Petr.
  Fixed problem that meant ShowErrorStatement could show wrong statement,
   thanks to Ron Savage for the report and test case.
  Changed Apache::DBI hook to check for $ENV{MOD_PERL} instead of
    $ENV{GATEWAY_INTERFACE} thanks to Ask Bjoern Hansen.
  No longer tries to dup trace logfp when an interpreter is being cloned.
  Database handles no longer inherit shared $h-&gt;err/errstr/state storage
    from their drivers, so each $dbh has it's own $h-&gt;err etc. values
    and is no longer affected by calls made on other dbh's.
    Now when a dbh is destroyed it's err/errstr/state values are copied
    up to the driver so checking $DBI::errstr still works as expected.</PRE>
<PRE>
  Build / portability fixes:
    Fixed t/40profile.t to not use Time::HiRes.
    Fixed t/06attrs.t to not be locale sensitive, reported by Christian Hammers.
    Fixed sgi compiler warnings, reported by Paul Blake.
    Fixed build using make -j4, reported by Jonathan Leffler.
    Fixed build and tests under VMS thanks to Craig A. Berry.</PRE>
<PRE>
  Documentation changes:
    Documented $high_resolution_time = dbi_time() function.
    Documented that bind_col() can take an atribute hash.
    Clarified documentation for ParamValues attribute hash keys.
    Many good DBI documentation tweaks from Jonathan Leffler,
      including a major update to the DBI::DBD driver author guide.
    Clarified that execute() should itself call finish() if it's
      called on a statement handle that's still active.
    Clarified $sth-&gt;{ParamValues}. Driver authors please note.
    Removed &quot;NEW&quot; markers on some methods and attributes and
      added text to each giving the DBI version it was added in,
      if it was added after DBI 1.21 (Feb 2002).</PRE>
<PRE>
  Changes of note for authors of all drivers:
    Added SQL_DATA_TYPE, SQL_DATETIME_SUB, NUM_PREC_RADIX, and
      INTERVAL_PRECISION fields to docs for type_info_all. There were
      already in type_info(), but type_info_all() didn't specify the
      index values.  Please check and update your type_info_all() code.
    Added DBI::DBD::Metadata module that auto-generates your drivers
      get_info and type_info_all data and code, thanks mainly to
      Jonathan Leffler and Steffen Goeldner. If you've not implemented
      get_info and type_info_all methods and your database has an ODBC
      driver available then this will do all the hard work for you!
    Drivers should no longer pass Err, Errstr, or State to _new_drh
      or _new_dbh functions.
    Please check that you support the slightly modified behaviour of
      $sth-&gt;{ParamValues}, e.g., always return hash with keys if possible.</PRE>
<PRE>
  Changes of note for authors of compiled drivers:
    Added dbd_db_login6 &amp; dbd_st_finish3 prototypes thanks to Jonathan Leffler.
    All dbd_*_*() functions implemented by drivers must have a
      corresponding #define dbd_*_* &lt;driver_prefix&gt;_*_* otherwise
      the driver may not work with a future release of the DBI.</PRE>
<PRE>
  Changes of note for authors of drivers which use Driver.xst:
    Some new method hooks have been added are are enabled by
      defining corresponding macros:
          $drh-&gt;data_sources()      - dbd_dr_data_sources
          $dbh-&gt;do()                - dbd_db_do4
    The following methods won't be compiled into the driver unless
      the corresponding macro has been #defined:
          $drh-&gt;disconnect_all()    - dbd_discon_all</PRE>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="changes in dbi 1.32, 1st december 2002">Changes in DBI 1.32,    1st December 2002</A></H2>
<PRE>
  Fixed to work with 5.005_03 thanks to Tatsuhiko Miyagawa (I've not tested it).
  Reenabled taint tests (accidentally left disabled) spotted by Bradley Baetz.
  Improved docs for FetchHashKeyName attribute thanks to Ian Barwick.
  Fixed core dump if fetchrow_hashref given bad argument (name of attribute
    with a value that wasn't an array reference), spotted by Ian Barwick.
  Fixed some compiler warnings thanks to David Wheeler.
  Updated Steven Hirsch's enhanced proxy work (seems I left out a bit).
  Made t/40profile.t tests more reliable, reported by Randy, who is part of
    the excellent CPAN testers team: <A HREF="http://testers.cpan.org/">http://testers.cpan.org/</A>
    (Please visit, see the valuable work they do and, ideally, join in!)</PRE>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="changes in dbi 1.31, 29th november 2002">Changes in DBI 1.31,    29th November 2002</A></H2>
<PRE>
  The fetchall_arrayref method, when called with a $maxrows parameter,
    no longer gives an error if called again after all rows have been
    fetched. This simplifies application logic when fetching in batches.
    Also added batch-fetch while() loop example to the docs.
  The proxy now supports non-lazy (synchronous) prepare, positioned
    updates (for selects containing 'for update'), PlRPC config set
    via attributes, and accurate propagation of errors, all thanks
    to Steven Hirsch (plus a minor fix from Sean McMurray and doc
    tweaks from Michael A Chase).
  The DBI_AUTOPROXY env var can now hold the full dsn of the proxy driver
    plus attributes, like &quot;dbi:Proxy(proxy_foo=&gt;1):host=...&quot;.
  Added TaintIn &amp; TaintOut attributes to give finer control over
    tainting thanks to Bradley Baetz.
  The RootClass attribute no longer ignores failure to load a module,
    but also doesn't try to load a module if the class already exists,
    with thanks to James FitzGibbon.
  HandleError attribute works for connect failures thanks to David Wheeler.
  The connect() RaiseError/PrintError message now includes the username.
  Changed &quot;last handle unknown or destroyed&quot; warning to be a trace message.
  Removed undocumented $h-&gt;event() method.
  Further enhancements to DBD::PurePerl accuracy.
  The CursorName attribute now defaults to undef and not an error.</PRE>
<PRE>
  DBI::Profile changes:
    New DBI::ProfileDumper, DBI::ProfileDumper::Apache, and
    DBI::ProfileData modules (to manage the storage and processing
    of profile data), plus dbiprof program for analyzing profile
    data - with many thanks to Sam Tregar.
    Added $DBI::err (etc) tied variable lookup time to profile.
    Added time for DESTROY method into parent handles profile (used to be ignored).</PRE>
<PRE>
  Documentation changes:
    Documented $dbh = $sth-&gt;{Database} attribute.
    Documented $dbh-&gt;connected(...) post-connection call when subclassing.
    Updated some minor doc issues thanks to H.Merijn Brand.
    Updated Makefile.PL example in DBI::DBD thanks to KAWAI,Takanori.
    Fixed execute_array() example thanks to Peter van Hardenberg.</PRE>
<PRE>
  Changes for driver authors, not required but strongly recommended:
    Change DBIS to DBIc_DBISTATE(imp_xxh)   [or imp_dbh, imp_sth etc]
    Change DBILOGFP to DBIc_LOGPIO(imp_xxh) [or imp_dbh, imp_sth etc]
    Any function from which all instances of DBIS and DBILOGFP are
    removed can also have dPERLINTERP removed (a good thing).
    All use of the DBIh_EVENT* macros should be removed.
    Major update to DBI::DBD docs thanks largely to Jonathan Leffler.
    Add these key values: 'Err' =&gt; \my $err, 'Errstr' =&gt; \my $errstr,
    to the hash passed to DBI::_new_dbh() in your driver source code.
    That will make each $dbh have it's own $h-&gt;err and $h-&gt;errstr
    values separate from other $dbh belonging to the same driver.
    If you have a ::db or ::st DESTROY methods that do nothing
    you can now remove them - which speeds up handle destruction.</PRE>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="changes in dbi 1.30, 18th july 2002">Changes in DBI 1.30,    18th July 2002</A></H2>
<PRE>
  Fixed problems with selectrow_array, selectrow_arrayref, and
    selectall_arrayref introduced in DBI 1.29.
  Fixed FETCHing a handle attribute to not clear $DBI::err etc (broken in 1.29).
  Fixed core dump at trace level 9 or above.
  Fixed compilation with perl 5.6.1 + ithreads (i.e. Windows).
  Changed definition of behaviour of selectrow_array when called in a scalar
    context to match fetchrow_array.

<H2><A NAME="changes in dbi 1.29, 15th july 2002">Changes in DBI 1.29,    15th July 2002</A></H2>
<PRE>
  NOTE: This release changes the specified behaviour for the
  : fetchrow_array method when called in a scalar context:
  : The DBI spec used to say that it would return the FIRST field.
  : Which field it returns (i.e., the first or the last) is now undefined.
  : This does not affect statements that only select one column, which is
  : usually the case when fetchrow_array is called in a scalar context.
  : FYI, this change was triggered by discovering that the fetchrow_array
  : implementation in Driver.xst (used by most compiled drivers) 
  : didn't match the DBI specification. Rather than change the code
  : to match, and risk breaking existing applications, I've changed the
  : specification (that part was always of dubious value anyway).</PRE>
<PRE>
  NOTE: Future versions of the DBI may not support for perl 5.5 much longer.
  : If you are still using perl 5.005_03 you should be making plans to
  : upgrade to at least perl 5.6.1, or 5.8.0. Perl 5.8.0 is due to be
  : released in the next week or so.  (Although it's a &quot;point 0&quot; release,
  : it is the most throughly tested release ever.)</PRE>
<PRE>
  Added XS/C implementations of selectrow_array, selectrow_arrayref, and
    selectall_arrayref to Driver.xst. See DBI 1.26 Changes for more info.
  Removed support for the old (fatally flawed) &quot;5005&quot; threading model.
  Added support for new perl 5.8 iThreads thanks to Gerald Richter.
    (Threading support and safety should still be regarded as beta
    quality until further notice. But it's much better than it was.)
  Updated the &quot;Threads and Thread Safety&quot; section of the docs.
  The trace output can be sent to STDOUT instead of STDERR by using
    &quot;STDOUT&quot; as the name of the file, i.e., $h-&gt;trace(..., &quot;STDOUT&quot;)
  Added pointer to perlreftut, perldsc, perllol, and perlboot manuals
    into the intro section of the docs, suggested by Brian McCain.
  Fixed DBI::Const::GetInfo::* pod docs thanks to Zack Weinberg.
  Some changes to how $dbh method calls are treated by DBI::Profile:
    Meta-data methods now clear $dbh-&gt;{Statement} on entry.
    Some $dbh methods are now profiled as if $dbh-&gt;{Statement} was empty
    (because thet're unlikely to actually relate to its contents).
  Updated dbiport.h to ppport.h from perl 5.8.0.
  Tested with perl 5.5.3 (vanilla, Solaris), 5.6.1 (vanilla, Solaris), and
    perl 5.8.0 (RC3@17527 with iThreads &amp; Multiplicity on Solaris and FreeBSD).</PRE>

<PRE>
  Added $sth-&gt;{ParamValues} to return a hash of the most recent
    values bound to placeholders via bind_param() or execute().
    Individual drivers need to be updated to support it.
  Enhanced ShowErrorStatement to include ParamValues if available:
    &quot;DBD::foo::st execute failed: errstr [for statement ``...'' with params: 1='foo']&quot;
  Further enhancements to DBD::PurePerl accuracy.</PRE>

<PRE>
  Fixed t/40profile.t to work on Windows thanks to Smejkal Petr.
  Fixed $h-&gt;{Profile} to return undef, not error, if not set.
  Fixed DBI-&gt;available_drivers in scalar context thanks to Michael Schwern.</PRE>
<PRE>
  Added C implementations of selectrow_arrayref() and fetchall_arrayref()
    in Driver.xst.  All compiled drivers using Driver.xst will now be
    faster making those calls. Most noticable with fetchall_arrayref for
    many rows or selectrow_arrayref with a fast query. For example, using
    DBD::mysql a selectrow_arrayref for a single row using a primary key
    is ~20% faster, and fetchall_arrayref for 20000 rows is twice as fast!
    Drivers just need to be recompiled and reinstalled to enable it.
    The fetchall_arrayref speed up only applies if $slice parameter is not used.
  Added $max_rows parameter to fetchall_arrayref() to optionally limit
    the number of rows returned. Can now fetch batches of rows.
  Added MaxRows attribute to selectall_arrayref()
    which then passes it to fetchall_arrayref().
  Changed selectrow_array to make use of selectrow_arrayref.
  Trace level 1 now shows first two parameters of all methods
    (used to only for that for some, like prepare,execute,do etc)
  Trace indicator for recursive calls (first char on trace lines)
    now starts at 1 not 2.</PRE>
<PRE>
  Documented that $h-&gt;func() does not trigger RaiseError etc
    so applications must explicitly check for errors.
  DBI::Profile with DBI_PROFILE now shows percentage time inside DBI.
  HandleError docs updated to show that handler can edit error message.
  HandleError subroutine interface is now regarded as stable.</PRE>

<H2><A NAME="changes in dbi 1.25, 5th june 2002">Changes in DBI 1.25,    5th June 2002</A></H2>

  Fixed build problem on Windows and some compiler warnings.
  Fixed $dbh-&gt;{Driver} and $sth-&gt;{Statement} for driver internals
    These are 'inner' handles as per behaviour prior to DBI 1.16.
  Further minor improvements to DBI::PurePerl accuracy.</PRE>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="changes in dbi 1.24, 4th june 2002">Changes in DBI 1.24,    4th June 2002</A></H2>
<PRE>
  Fixed reference loop causing a handle/memory leak
    that was introduced in DBI 1.16.
  Fixed DBI::Format to work with 'filehandles' from IO::Scalar
    and similar modules thanks to report by Jeff Boes.
  Fixed $h-&gt;func for DBI::PurePerl thanks to Jeff Zucker.
  Fixed $dbh-&gt;{Name} for DBI::PurePerl thanks to Dean Arnold.</PRE>
<PRE>
  Added DBI method call profiling and benchmarking.
    This is a major new addition to the DBI.
    See $h-&gt;{Profile} attribute and DBI::Profile module.
    For a quick trial, set the DBI_PROFILE environment variable and
    run your favourite DBI script. Try it with DBI_PROFILE set to 1,
    then try 2, 4, 8, 10, and -10. Have fun!</PRE>
<PRE>
  Added execute_array() and bind_param_array() documentation
    with thanks to Dean Arnold.
  Added notes about the DBI having not yet been tested with iThreads
    (testing and patches for SvLOCK etc welcome).
  Removed undocumented Handlers attribute (replaced by HandleError).
  Tested with 5.5.3 and 5.8.0 RC1.</PRE>

<PRE>
  Fixed DBD::Proxy support for AutoCommit thanks to Jochen Wiedmann.
  Fixed DBI::ProxyServer bind_param(_inout) handing thanks to Oleg Mechtcheriakov.
  Fixed DBI::ProxyServer fetch loop thanks to nobull@mail.com.
  Fixed install_driver do-the-right-thing with $@ on error. It, and connect(),
    will leave $@ empty on success and holding the error message on error.
    Thanks to Jay Lawrence, Gavin Sherlock and others for the bug report.
  Fixed fetchrow_hashref to assign columns to the hash left-to-right
    so later fields with the same name overwrite earlier ones
    as per DBI &lt; 1.15, thanks to Kay Roepke.</PRE>
<PRE>
  Changed tables() to use quote_indentifier() if the driver returns a
    true value for $dbh-&gt;get_info(29) # SQL_IDENTIFIER_QUOTE_CHAR
  Changed ping() so it no longer triggers RaiseError/PrintError.
  Changed connect() to not call $class-&gt;install_driver unless needed.
  Changed DESTROY to catch fatal exceptions and append to $@.</PRE>
<PRE>
  Added ISO SQL/CLI &amp; ODBCv3 data type definitions thanks to Steffen Goeldner.
  Removed the definition of SQL_BIGINT data type constant as the value is
    inconsistent between standards (ODBC=-5, SQL/CLI=25).
  Added $dbh-&gt;column_info(...) thanks to Steffen Goeldner.
  Added $dbh-&gt;foreign_key_info(...) thanks to Steffen Goeldner.
  Added $dbh-&gt;quote_identifier(...) insipred by Simon Oliver.
  Added $dbh-&gt;set_err(...) for DBD authors and DBI subclasses
    (actually been there for a while, now expanded and documented).
  Added $h-&gt;{HandleError} = sub { ... } addition and/or alternative
    to RaiseError/PrintError. See the docs for more info.
  Added $h-&gt;{TraceLevel} = N attribute to set/get trace level of handle
    thus can set trace level via an (eg externally specified) DSN
    using the embedded attribute syntax:
      $dsn = 'dbi:DB2(PrintError=1,TraceLevel=2):dbname';
    Plus, you can also now do: local($h-&gt;{TraceLevel}) = N;
    (but that leaks a little memory in some versions of perl).
  Added some call tree information to trace output if trace level &gt;= 3
    With thanks to Graham Barr for the stack walking code.
  Added experimental undocumented $dbh-&gt;preparse(), see t/preparse.t
    With thanks to Scott T. Hildreth for much of the work.
  Added Fowler/Noll/Vo hash type as an option to DBI::hash().</PRE>
<PRE>
  Documentation changes:</PRE>
<PRE>
  Added DBI::Changes so now you can &quot;perldoc DBI::Changes&quot;, yeah!
  Added selectrow_arrayref &amp; selectrow_hashref docs thanks to Doug Wilson.
  Added 'Standards Reference Information' section to docs to gather
    together all references to relevant on-line standards.
  Added link to poop.sourceforge.net into the docs thanks to Dave Rolsky.
  Added link to hyperlinked BNF for SQL92 thanks to Jeff Zucker.
  Added 'Subclassing the DBI' docs thanks to Stephen Clouse, and
    then changed some of them to reflect the new approach to subclassing.
  Added stronger wording to description of $h-&gt;{private_*} attributes.
  Added docs for DBI::hash.</PRE>
<PRE>
  Driver API changes:</PRE>
<PRE>
  Now a COPY of the DBI-&gt;connect() attributes is passed to the driver
    connect() method, so it can process and delete any elements it wants.
    Deleting elements reduces/avoids the explicit
      $dbh-&gt;{$_} = $attr-&gt;{$_} foreach keys %$attr;
    that DBI-&gt;connect does after the driver connect() method returns.</PRE>

<PRE>
  WARNING: This release contains two changes that may affect your code.
  : Any code using selectall_hashref(), which was added in March 2001, WILL
  : need to be changed. Any code using fetchall_arrayref() with a non-empty
  : hash slice parameter may, in a few rare cases, need to be changed.
  : See the change list below for more information about the changes.
  : See the DBI documentation for a description of current behaviour.</PRE>
<PRE>
  Fixed memory leak thanks to Toni Andjelkovic.
  Changed fetchall_arrayref({ foo=&gt;1, ...}) specification again (sorry):
    The key names of the returned hashes is identical to the letter case of
    the names in the parameter hash, regardless of the L&lt;/FetchHashKeyName&gt;
    attribute. The letter case is ignored for matching.
  Changed fetchall_arrayref([...]) array slice syntax specification to
    clarify that the numbers in the array slice are perl index numbers
    (which start at 0) and not column numbers (which start at 1).
  Added { Columns=&gt;... } and { Slice =&gt;... } attributes to selectall_arrayref()
    which is passed to fetchall_arrayref() so it can fetch hashes now.
  Added a { Columns =&gt; [...] } attribute to selectcol_arrayref() so that
    the list it returns can be built from more than one column per row.
    Why? Consider my %hash = @{$dbh-&gt;selectcol_arrayref($sql,{ Columns=&gt;[1,2]})}
    to return id-value pairs which can be used directly to build a hash.
  Added $hash_ref = $sth-&gt;fetchall_hashref( $key_field )
    which returns a ref to a hash with, typically, one element per row.
    $key_field is the name of the field to get the key for each row from.
    The value of the hash for each row is a hash returned by fetchrow_hashref.
  Changed selectall_hashref to return a hash ref (from fetchall_hashref)
    and not an array of hashes as it has since DBI 1.15 (end March 2001).
    WARNING: THIS CHANGE WILL BREAK ANY CODE USING selectall_hashref()!
    Sorry, but I think this is an important regularization of the API.
    To get previous selectall_hashref() behaviour (an array of hash refs)
    change $ary_ref = $dbh-&gt;selectall_hashref( $statement, undef, @bind);
        to $ary_ref = $dbh-&gt;selectall_arrayref($statement, { Columns=&gt;{} }, @bind);
  Added NAME_lc_hash, NAME_uc_hash, NAME_hash statement handle attributes.
    which return a ref to a hash of field_name =&gt; field_index (0..n-1) pairs.
  Fixed select_hash() example thanks to Doug Wilson.
  Removed (unbundled) DBD::ADO and DBD::Multiplex from the DBI distribution.
    The latest versions of those modules are available from CPAN sites.
  Added $dbh-&gt;begin_work. This method causes AutoCommit to be turned
    off just until the next commit() or rollback().
    Driver authors: if the DBIcf_BegunWork flag is set when your commit or
    rollback method is called then please turn AutoCommit on and clear the
    DBIcf_BegunWork flag. If you don't then the DBI will but it'll be much
    less efficient and won't handle error conditions very cleanly.
  Retested on perl 5.4.4, but the DBI won't support 5.4.x much longer.
  Added text to SUPPORT section of the docs:
    For direct DBI and DBD::Oracle support, enhancement, and related work
    I am available for consultancy on standard commercial terms.
  Added text to ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS section of the docs:
    Much of the DBI and DBD::Oracle was developed while I was Technical
    Director (CTO) of the Paul Ingram Group (www.ig.co.uk).  So I'd
    especially like to thank Paul for his generosity and vision in
    supporting this work for many years.</PRE>

<PRE>
  Made fetchall_arrayref({ foo=&gt;1, ...}) be more strict to the specification
    in relation to wanting hash slice keys to be lowercase names.
    WARNING: If you've used fetchall_arrayref({...}) with a hash slice
    that contains keys with uppercase letters then your code will break.
    (As far as I recall the spec has always said don't do that.)
  Fixed $sth-&gt;execute() to update $dbh-&gt;{Statement} to $sth-&gt;{Statement}.
  Added row number to trace output for fetch method calls.
  Trace level 1 no longer shows fetches with row&gt;1 (to reduce output volume).
  Added $h-&gt;{FetchHashKeyName} = 'NAME_lc' or 'NAME_uc' to alter
    behaviour of fetchrow_hashref() method. See docs.
  Added type_info quote caching to quote() method thanks to Dean Kopesky.
    Makes using quote() with second data type param much much faster.
  Added type_into_all() caching to type_info(), spotted by Dean Kopesky.
  Added new API definition for table_info() and tables(),
    driver authors please note!
  Added primary_key_info() to DBI API thanks to Steffen Goeldner.
  Added primary_key() to DBI API as simpler interface to primary_key_info().
  Indent and other fixes for DBI::DBD doc thanks to H.Merijn Brand.
  Added prepare_cached() insert_hash() example thanks to Doug Wilson.
  Removed false docs for fetchall_hashref(), use fetchall_arrayref({}).</PRE>

  Added DBI_USER and DBI_PASS env vars. See connect docs for usage.
  Added DBI-&gt;trace() to set global trace level (like per-handle $h-&gt;trace).
  PERL_DBI_DEBUG env var renamed DBI_DEBUG (old name still works for now).

  Since the DBIS structure has change the internal version numbers have also
  changed (DBIXS_VERSION == 9 and DBISTATE_VERSION == 9) so drivers will have
  to be recompiled. The test is also now more sensitive and the version
  mismatch error message now more clear about what to do. Old drivers are
  likely to core dump (this time) until recompiled for this DBI. In future
  DBI/DBD version mismatch will always produce a clear error message.</PRE>

  The DBI-&gt;data_sources method should return data_source
  names with the appropriate 'dbi:driver:' prefix.
  DBI-&gt;connect will warn if \%attr is true but not a hash ref.

    $ary_ref  = $sth-&gt;fetchrow_arrayref;
    $hash_ref = $sth-&gt;fetchrow_hashref;

  directive to define aliases for fetch and fetchrow).
  Fixed occasional problems with t/examp.t test.
  Added automatic errstr reporting to the debug trace output.

  Added VMS support thanks to Dan Sugalski.

<PRE>
  Added $DBI::state to hold SQL CLI / ODBC SQLSTATE value.
  SQLSTATE &quot;00000&quot; (success) is returned as &quot;&quot; (false), all else is true.
  If a driver does not explicitly initialise it (via $h-&gt;{State} or
  DBIc_STATE(imp_xxh) then $DBI::state will automatically return &quot;&quot; if
  $DBI::err is false otherwise &quot;S1000&quot; (general error).
  As always, this is a new feature and liable to change.</PRE>
<PRE>
  The is *no longer* a default error handler!
  You can add your own using push(@{$h-&gt;{Handlers}}, sub { ... })
  but be aware that this interface may change (or go away).</PRE>
<PRE>
  The DBI now automatically clears $DBI::err, errstr and state before
  calling most DBI methods. Previously error conditions would persist.
  Added DBIh_CLEAR_ERROR(imp_xxh) macro.</PRE>
<PRE>
  DBI now EXPORT_OK's some utility functions, neat($value),
  neat_list(@values) and dump_results($sth).</PRE>
<PRE>
  Slightly enhanced t/min.t minimal test script in an effort to help
  narrow down the few stray core dumps that some porters still report.</PRE>
<PRE>
  Renamed readblob to blob_read (old name still works but warns).
  Added default blob_copy_to_file method.</PRE>
<PRE>
  Added $sth = $dbh-&gt;tables method. This returns an $sth for a query
  which has these columns: TABLE_CATALOGUE, TABLE_OWNER, TABLE_NAME,
  TABLE_TYPE, REMARKS in that order. The TABLE_CATALOGUE column
  should be ignored for now.</PRE>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="changes in dbi 0.64, 23 oct 1995">Changes in DBI 0.64,	23 Oct 1995</A></H2>
<PRE>
  Fixed 'disconnect invalidates 1 associated cursor(s)' problem.
  Drivers using DBIc_ACTIVE_on/off() macros should not need any changes
  other than to test for DBIc_ACTIVE_KIDS() instead of DBIc_KIDS().
  Fixed possible core dump in dbih_clearcom during global destruction.</PRE>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="changes in dbi 0.63, 1 sep 1995">Changes in DBI 0.63,	1 Sep 1995</A></H2>
<PRE>
  Minor update. Fixed uninitialised memory bug in method
  attribute handling and streamlined processing and debugging.
  Revised usage definitions for bind_* methods and readblob.</PRE>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="changes in dbi 0.62, 26 aug 1995">Changes in DBI 0.62,	26 Aug 1995</A></H2>
<PRE>
  Added method redirection method $h-&gt;func(..., $method_name).
  This is now the official way to call private driver methods
  that are not part of the DBI standard.  E.g.:
      @ary = $sth-&gt;func('ora_types');
  It can also be used to call existing methods. Has very low cost.</PRE>
<PRE>
  $sth-&gt;bind_col columns now start from 1 (not 0) to match SQL.
  $sth-&gt;bind_columns now takes a leading attribute parameter (or undef),
  e.g., $sth-&gt;bind_columns($attribs, \$col1 [, \$col2 , ...]);</PRE>
<PRE>
  Added handy DBD_ATTRIBS_CHECK macro to vet attribs in XS.
  Added handy DBD_ATTRIB_GET_SVP, DBD_ATTRIB_GET_BOOL and
  DBD_ATTRIB_GET_IV macros for handling attributes.</PRE>
<PRE>
  Fixed STORE for NUM_OF_FIELDS and NUM_OF_PARAMS.
  Added FETCH for NUM_OF_FIELDS and NUM_OF_PARAMS.</PRE>
<PRE>
  Dispatch no longer bothers to call _untie().
  Faster startup via install_method/_add_dispatch changes.</PRE>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="changes in dbi 0.61, 22 aug 1995">Changes in DBI 0.61,	22 Aug 1995</A></H2>
<PRE>
  Added $sth-&gt;bind_col($column, \$var [, \%attribs ]);</PRE>
<PRE>
  This method enables perl variable to be directly and automatically
  updated when a row is fetched. It requires no driver support
  (if the driver has been written to use DBIS-&gt;get_fbav).
  Currently \%attribs is unused.</PRE>
<PRE>
  Added $sth-&gt;bind_columns(\$var [, \$var , ...]);</PRE>
<PRE>
  This method is a short-cut for bind_col which binds all the
  columns of a query in one go (with no attributes). It also
  requires no driver support.</PRE>
<PRE>
  Added $sth-&gt;bind_param($parameter, $var [, \%attribs ]);</PRE>
<PRE>
  This method enables attributes to be specified when values are
  bound to placeholders. It also enables binding to occur away
  from the execute method to improve execute efficiency.
  The DBI does not provide a default implementation of this.
  See the DBD::Oracle module for a detailed example.</PRE>
<PRE>
  The DBI now provides default implementations of both fetch and
  fetchrow.  Each is written in terms of the other. A driver is
  expected to implement at least one of them.</PRE>
<PRE>
  More macro and assorted structure changes in DBDXS.h. Sorry!
  The old dbihcom definitions have gone. All fields have macros.
  The imp_xxh_t type is now used within the DBI as well as drivers.
  Drivers must set DBIc_NUM_FIELDS(imp_sth) and DBIc_NUM_PARAMS(imp_sth).</PRE>
<PRE>
  test.pl includes a trivial test of bind_param and bind_columns.</PRE>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="changes in dbi 0.60, 17 aug 1995">Changes in DBI 0.60,	17 Aug 1995</A></H2>
<PRE>
  This release has significant code changes but much less
  dramatic than the previous release. The new implementors data
  handling mechanism has matured significantly (don't be put off
  by all the struct typedefs in DBIXS.h, there's just to make it
  easier for drivers while keeping things type-safe).</PRE>
<PRE>
  The DBI now includes two new methods:</PRE>
<PRE>
  do            $dbh-&gt;do($statement)</PRE>
<PRE>
  This method prepares, executes and finishes a statement. It is
  designed to be used for executing one-off non-select statements
  where there is no benefit in reusing a prepared statement handle.</PRE>
<PRE>
  fetch         $array_ref = $sth-&gt;fetch;</PRE>
<PRE>
  This method is the new 'lowest-level' row fetching method. The
  previous @row = $sth-&gt;fetchrow method now defaults to calling
  the fetch method and expanding the returned array reference.</PRE>
<PRE>
  The DBI now provides fallback attribute FETCH and STORE functions
  which drivers should call if they don't recognise an attribute.</PRE>
<PRE>
  THIS RELEASE IS A GOOD STARTING POINT FOR DRIVER DEVELOPERS!
  Study DBIXS.h from the DBI and Oracle.xs etc from DBD::Oracle.
  There will be further changes in the interface but nothing
  as dramatic as these last two releases! (I hope :-)</PRE>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="changes in dbi 0.59 15 aug 1995">Changes in DBI 0.59	15 Aug 1995</A></H2>
<PRE>
  NOTE: THIS IS AN UNSTABLE RELEASE!</PRE>
<PRE>
  Major reworking of internal data management!
  Performance improvements and memory leaks fixed.
  Added a new NullP (empty) driver and a -m flag
  to test.pl to help check for memory leaks.
  Study DBD::Oracle version 0.21 for more details.
  (Comparing parts of v0.21 with v0.20 may be useful.)</PRE>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="changes in dbi 0.58 21 june 1995">Changes in DBI 0.58	21 June 1995</A></H2>
<PRE>
  Added DBI-&gt;internal-&gt;{DebugLog} = $filename;
  Reworked internal logging.
  Added $VERSION.
  Made disconnect_all a compulsary method for drivers.</PRE>
